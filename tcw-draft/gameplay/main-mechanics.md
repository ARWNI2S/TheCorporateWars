# Main Mechanics

In the galaxy, corporations are not mere commercial entities: they are fundamental pillars of the interplanetary economy.

From free traders to institutionalized megacorporations, these organizations weave networks of production, transportation, financing, and power that span entire sectors.

Each corporation combines resources, technology, personnel, and political capital to expand, consolidate, or simply survive in an environment where slow communications, economic rivalries, and diplomatic tensions are the norm.

{% hint style="success" %}
The core mechanics reflect this scenario: it is not enough to build, trade, or conquer; players must manage logistical chains, secure strategic information, maintain efficient command structures, and negotiate permits, concessions, and alliances across multiple levels.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The player does not command an omniscient empire. They control an organization with blind spots, dependent on agents, contracts, and fleets to operate across a fragmented galactic map, where absolute present knowledge is never available and every decision carries echoes far beyond what was anticipated.

## Economy

The interstellar economy fuses local interactions with large-scale market dynamics, reflecting the complexity of dispersed systems.

{% hint style="info" %}
Players trade across systems with dynamic prices shaped by supply, demand, transport risks, and local fluctuations.
{% endhint %}

Goods are not abstract tokens; they have mass, volume, storage conditions, and expiration dates.

Extracting planetary resources requires permits, technologies, and specialized personnel.

Production is never automatic: every facility comes with yields, maintenance demands, and bottlenecks.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Technological research unlocks improvements but consumes resources and time, forcing tensions between investing in today or betting on tomorrow.
{% endhint %}

Every microeconomic action —loading a ship, negotiating a contract, retooling a production line— directly impacts cash flow and operational stability.

{% hint style="info" %}
Players must optimize logistics, maintain profit margins, and compete for niche markets.

Attention to detail is what separates an agile operator from a bloated giant.
{% endhint %}

### Macroeconomy

At scale, players are shaped by and can influence regional markets.

Interstellar exchanges reflect key product trends.

Trade route bonds finance operations in exchange for future commitments.

{% hint style="info" %}
Macroeconomic fluctuations —crises, booms, bubbles— shift prices, confidence, and investments, forcing players to read the system pulse to shield or multiply their capital.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Interstellar banking forms the backbone of economic flows: it offers credit, manages deposits, and enables transfers between systems.
{% endhint %}

Without access to financing, few corporations weather market shifts, but debt brings obligations, interest, and the risk of intervention by creditors or sector guarantors.

## Governance

Order across the galaxy is never uniform, and corporations must navigate a patchwork of authorities.

From local governments to complex interstellar entities, guilds, and consortia, each actor defines rules shaping corporate play.

### Authority and Government

The legal and political framework is no decoration; it defines what can and cannot be done.

Each world, sector, or alliance enforces its own laws on trade, trafficking, weapons, technology, biotechnology, AI, or slavery, among others.

{% hint style="success" %}
Guilds act as interplanetary organizations able to grant exclusive licenses, impose sanctions, or mediate disputes.
{% endhint %}

Human, alien, or hybrid cultures add layers of social and political complexity that shape every corporate move.

Interstellar alliances introduce yet another layer of rules and restrictions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Players must navigate this mosaic, adapting strategies, selecting spheres of influence, or exploiting legal loopholes.
{% endhint %}

### Blockchain Governance

Blockchain is not mere backend; it becomes a playable tool, allowing contracts to be verified, assets to be tracked, and distributed governance to be established over territories, fleets, or resources.

{% hint style="success" %}
As a technological counterweight, blockchain governance audits assets, contracts, routes, and permissions with brutal transparency.
{% endhint %}

This mechanism distributes control and reinforces ecosystem self-sufficiency, ensuring even in decentralized environments a minimum of coherence and verifiable trust.

{% hint style="info" %}
Players can join collective decisions, build DAO mechanisms, or —quite literally— hack market trust.
{% endhint %}

## Diplomacy and Relations

Relations between galactic actors form a tangled web where treaties, alliances, secret pacts, and economic blockades reshape power balances.

Diplomacy is no mere façade; it's a strategic tool to open markets, gain access to exclusive technologies, or secure key routes.

Negotiating well can yield long-term gains, but it also breeds dependencies, and any alliance may fracture into threat.

{% hint style="info" %}
Players must read the context, anticipate ally and rival moves, and decide when to negotiate, when to press, and when to quietly withdraw.
{% endhint %}

### Security and Militarization

Protecting assets, fleets, and installations is a non-negotiable dimension of play.

Corporations may field anything from light convoy escorts to full battle fleets, supported by external contractors or internal security forces.

Quality, training, and morale are critical, and their costs are never trivial.

Militarization requires resource commitments but opens new avenues: military contracts, covert interventions, or territorial control by force.

### Covert Operations

Competition does not end at open markets or declared battlefields.

Covert operations enable players to infiltrate rival firms, sabotage critical infrastructure, corrupt local officials, or manipulate economic data to trigger market panics.

Such actions require specialized resources, planning, and an acceptable risk margin: failure can mean sanctions, reputational damage, or open war. For those who master this realm, the invisible is often more powerful than the seen.

### Piracy and Illegality

Piracy is a constant presence along interstellar routes: raiding freighters, sabotaging facilities, or trafficking restricted goods are viable —if dangerous— paths.

{% hint style="info" %}
Players who drift into illegal activities must manage underground networks, dodge patrols, and survive in an ecosystem where reputation is everything and alliances are as volatile as they are lucrative.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Going rogue is no mere "hard mode"; it opens unique narrative paths and mechanics where survival hinges on marginal reputations, shadow contacts, and constant evasion of institutional watchmen.
{% endhint %}

## Infrastructure and Logistics

A corporation's power is built atop its infrastructure.

Starports, logistical hubs, service stations, maintenance networks, and jump relays sustain the movement of goods, people, and data.

Without this network, even the most ambitious enterprise collapses.

Logistics is not just about efficiency —it is about survival.

{% hint style="info" %}
Players must decide where to invest, how to expand, and which routes to safeguard to keep their networks alive, resilient, and profitable amid external and internal threats.
{% endhint %}

### Internal Dynamics

Every corporation is a social ecosystem.

Within coexist executives, engineers, workers, unions, shareholders, and, at times, factions with conflicting interests.

Staff morale, internal political disputes, and departmental tensions can boost performance —or sink it.

Managing the inside is non-optional: ignore it, and face talent drain, internal sabotage, reputation crises, or operational collapse.

{% hint style="info" %}
Players must balance productivity, cohesion, and internal ambition.
{% endhint %}

### External Factors

The universe is indifferent to corporate plans.

Solar storms, gravitational failures, unknown epidemics, archaeological discoveries of extinct civilizations, or first-contact alien encounters can radically alter a region's outlook.

These crises or discoveries are not mere narrative fluff; they impact trade routes, affect morale, trigger mass migrations, or open singular opportunities.

Surviving corporations are those that understand the frontier thrives on unpredictability.
