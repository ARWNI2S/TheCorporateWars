# Solana

**The Corporate Wars** integrates blockchain components based on the **Solana protocol**, including support for SPL tokens and smart contract programs built using the **Anchor framework** and the **Token-2022** extension.

All blockchain-related components use open-source software licensed under permissive licenses, such as **Apache 2.0** and **MIT**, provided by the Solana Foundation and the wider developer community.

Alternate Reality Worlds acknowledges the use of:

* The **Solana SDKs and runtime**
* The **Anchor framework** for smart contract development
* The **Token-2022 standard** for enhanced SPL token functionality

These technologies are used in compliance with their respective open-source licenses. No part of this project claims ownership or endorsement by the **Solana Foundation**, and all code deployed on-chain is developed independently.
