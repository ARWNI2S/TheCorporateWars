# In-Game Governance

Governance in **The Corporate Wars** is not simply a set of rules: it is the living architecture that sustains the universe, the network of **Polities** that wield power, authority, and influence over territories, populations, assets, and actors.

Every decision, every interaction, and every transaction takes place within this composite ecosystem, where **Polities** are not isolated blocks, but dynamic objects capable of containing others, delegating functions, assuming responsibilities, and forming alliances or federations.

## **Polities**: a system of systems

The game universe is structured as a flexible hierarchy of polities. From the individual corporation, controlling assets and resources, to interstellar alliances dominating trade routes, each level is an autonomous actor that can link, subordinate, or confront others.

The Third Imperium governs the space between worlds, imposing rules of navigation, trade, and interstellar security.

However, each planet maintains its own local government, with its own laws, customs, and priorities.

Below that, organizations, trusts, holdings, and corporations cross borders, weaving networks of property, influence, and power that transcend local jurisdictions.

{% hint style="info" %}
This model is not linear: it is a composition of polities aggregated hierarchically, with varying scopes, contexts, and autonomy.
{% endhint %}

### Permissions, Licenses, and Properties

At the most immediate level, players act as individual **Polities**. Having something does not mean having it secured: rights of ownership, use, and usufruct are separate entities.

{% hint style="warning" %}
A player can grant the use of a ship without transferring ownership, mortgage assets to finance operations, or lose effective control over key resources amid disputes or raids.
{% endhint %}

Asset management is not static: it is a game in itself, where owning, protecting, delegating, or recovering defines not just the player's economy but their position within the surrounding web of authority.

### Local Governments

Each star system falls under a local government acting as an autonomous **Polity**.

Although generally managed by the AI, these governments may include players who have reached sufficient influence or integration.

However, even in such cases, players do not fully control the machinery of power: the civilian population, with its demands, crises, and aspirations, is an independent system actor.

{% hint style="info" %}
Local governments set the legal framework, determine what is permitted or sanctioned, and act as filters shaping the actions of corporations, alliances, and external actors within their space.
{% endhint %}

### Groupings of **Polities**

Groupings of **Polities** function as coordination networks that can take commercial, governmental, or institutional forms.

Commercial groupings are the most accessible to players, equivalent to guilds, allowing for multiple, public or anonymous memberships.

Governmental and institutional groupings, in contrast, are purely administrative **Polities**, managed at their core by the AI but capable of admitting other polities as affiliates.

{% hint style="warning" %}
These groupings create emergent authority structures: distributing rights, coordinating joint actions, establishing internal rules, and negotiating collectively on the broader game stage.
{% endhint %}

### Major Powers

The Imperium is one of the supreme **Polities** in terms of interstellar reach and influence, but it is not the only major actor at play.

Other powers —empires, confederations, alien coalitions, religious networks, corporate blocs— contest entire regions of the galaxy and maintain their own systems of authority.

These **Polities** set rules, impose regional regulations, and generate tensions that ripple through subordinate structures.

Economically, entities such as the Interstellar Stock Exchange (ISE) coordinate financial indices and market signals, but they are not the only reference point: regional markets, sectoral exchanges, and alternative circuits are part of the ecosystem.

These _**macro-polities**_ do not act as absolute arbiters, but as centers of gravity.

Players cannot directly control them, but they can influence their metrics, disrupt their balances, or benefit from their movements.

The decisions of these major powers cascade through alliances, corporations, local governments, and individual players, continuously reshaping the strategic landscape.

## A universe of dynamic composition

Governance in **The Corporate Wars** is not just a matter of narrative or setting: it is a technical architecture, built on systems of composition, aggregation, and propagation that sustain a persistent, distributed, and coherent universe.

**Polities** —from individual players to alliances, local governments, empires, or economic entities— are dynamic objects that assemble and disassemble in real time. These entities can contain others, delegate functions, assume responsibilities, and negotiate interactions, creating an ecosystem where authority and management do not rely on fixed hierarchies but on dynamically assembled structures.

### Decision mechanisms

Each **Polity** makes internal decisions using systems such as weighted voting, capital distribution, assignment of governance rights, or account control.

These decisions are technically reflected in specific accounts within the Solana network, validated through specialized programs and authorized signatures.

{% hint style="success" %}
Programs interpret data in accounts, verify relationships, validate operations, and ensure coherence among distributed actors, without relying on embedded object logic.
{% endhint %}

### Chains of authority

Authority propagates through hierarchical and aggregated structures: local governments, alliances, consortia, empires.

Technically, these relationships are represented as networks of interconnected accounts via program-derived addresses (PDAs), where each node reflects permissions, rights, and dynamic affiliations.

{% hint style="success" %}
Validation programs ensure that each operation —granting rights, integrating members, issuing licenses— is correctly recorded and that its impact can be traced across the network, respecting context, latency, and global coherence.
{% endhint %}

### Technical aggregation and propagation

The growth of a **Polity** —by adding assets, absorbing groups, or establishing alliances— does not depend on embedded object logic but on updating distributed structures reflecting that change.

Solana enables recording these movements as account updates, propagating them efficiently and traceably, integrated within the model of asynchronous information.

Thus, governance, authority, and administration are not abstract concepts: they are technical systems supported by the same infrastructure that allows for a persistent, distributed, and verifiable universe, without the need to replicate models from other chains.
