# Future Development

The blockchain-based infrastructure opens the door to exploring development paths that go far beyond mere state recording. Among the most advanced technical possibilities we are considering:

These lines are not part of the core design or the immediate official roadmap, but they are areas of active exploration that could redefine blockchain's potential in ecosystems focused exclusively on virtual worlds.

### Alternative timelines

Thanks to Solana's intrinsic versioning (proof-of-history + Merkle trees), it is technically possible to **fork at a historical point** and generate a divergent timeline, creating parallel environments.\
This would theoretically allow us to:

* create "what if..." scenarios,
* experiment with multiverse mechanics and **pocket universes**,
* or launch time-limited campaigns with alternative rulesets.

### Time travel simulation (gameified)

While not part of the Traveller™ canon, exploring the technical consequences of operating on historical snapshots —and the aforementioned forks— would allow us to model:

* missions that interact with past data,
* probabilistic forecasting systems,
* or even —_data archaeology_— mechanics, where recovering, reinterpreting, or even sabotaging past information alters the present.

### Applied sci-fi exploration

The technical ecosystem of **The Corporate Wars** is not limited to mimicking classic sci-fi canon; it enables us to raise cutting-edge questions:

* What does it mean to manipulate distributed consensus in a persistent universe?
* How far can a blockchain serve not just as a ledger, but as a simulator of possibilities?
* How can we integrate these ideas without breaking strategic coherence or game balance?
