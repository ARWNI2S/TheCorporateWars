# Milestones

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Project Start**

_**1-1-2025**_ - New year, new project. Ideas mature, and the technology is available; everything falls into place.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Document Publication**

_**31-3-2025**_ - The arduous task of reflecting the concepts in an intelligible way for most humans is complete.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Legal Milestone**

_**4-6-2025**_ – We received written confirmation from Mongoose Publishing that **The Corporate Wars** may reference Traveller™ as inspiration under the Fair Use Policy 2025, without infringing copyright or trademarks. All third-party licenses (Epic, Unreal Engine, EOS, Solana, Microsoft) have been collected, reviewed, and made public when legally allowed. The legal architecture of the project is now stable and ready for audit, publication, and store compliance.
{% endstep %}

**Gameplay Prototyping**

Currently in process. In this stage, we are developing the basic client gameplay in **Unreal Engine 5**, implementing the macroeconomy on **Solana devnet**, and developing the game’s secure APIs and services.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Alphatest**

Deployment of blockchain infrastructure on **Solana testnet**, low-performance cloud servers. Analyzing gameplay improvements and economic balance. Adjustments to blockchain dynamics, automation, and batching of transactions with no fees for users.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Fundraising**

Start of commercial product development, ICO launch, and **MCr** vesting contracts on **Solana mainnet**. Recruitment and operational kick-off, preparing to conquer the interstellar economy.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Betatest**

Launch on **Epic Games**, full gameplay, no DLC, no Pay to Win, no exclusive marketplaces — just **The Corporate Wars**, install, link wallet, and recapitalize the company from day 0 because you didn’t understand what this is about.
