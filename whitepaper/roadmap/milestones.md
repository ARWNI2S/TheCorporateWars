# Milestones

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Project Kickoff**

_**1-1-2025**_ — New year, new project. The ideas have matured, the technology is available; all the pieces fall into place.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Publication of This Document**

_**31-3-2025**_ — The arduous task of making the concepts intelligible to most humans is finally complete. We publish this technical document as a living entity, open to corrections and design changes.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Legal Milestone**

_**4-6-2025**_ — We received written confirmation from Mongoose Publishing authorizing **The Corporate Wars** to reference Traveller™ as inspiration, under the terms of the Fair Use Policy 2025, without infringing copyright or trademark.\
All third-party licenses (Epic, Unreal Engine, EOS, Solana, Microsoft) have been collected, reviewed, and published where legally permitted.\
The project’s legal architecture is consolidated and ready for audits, store publication, and regulatory compliance.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Traveller™ Adaptation**

_**Q3 2025**_ — Having inspired the entire design process, with key elements directly adopted from conventional structures of tabletop mechanics, adapting **The Corporate Wars** to the _next milieu_ has been remarkably smooth.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Milieu 0 – First Survey**

_**Q4 2025**_ — Launch of the **First Survey**, consolidation of the initial **Polities**, and activation of the base economy.

This phase represents the system’s **foundational fundraising**, aligned with governance logic and economic simulation.\
The first **MCr** are distributed, the legal architecture is defined, and key contracts are deployed on **Solana**.\
In parallel, the **client framework** is developed in **Unreal Engine 5**, focused on visual navigation of Solana-deployed content.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Traveller™ – Second Survey**

Stage focused on visual deployment, art, interfaces, effects, and the interactive client.

Worlds, routes, Políticas, and economies external to the Third Imperium are integrated.\
The service network is deployed and real testing begins on complex environments.

Minimum gameplay mechanics are activated, along with interstellar navigation and structural data inspection.\
The galaxy begins to be seen, felt, and explored.

Lore, gameplay, and real-time systems start to converge.\
Additional gameplay modules are developed incrementally.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**The Corporate Wars – Closed Beta**

_**TBD 2027**_ — Restricted testing stage with selected players.

The complete system is tested in a production-grade environment: playable economy, real-time services, security, performance, and distributed synchronization.

Includes full visualization, stellar navigation, basic economy modules, and initial governance structures.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Open Beta**

_**TBD 2027**_ — Public access for all players, with persistent progression.

The full system enters massive stress testing: interstellar logistics, functional corporations, decentralized governance, and active deep-space exploration.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Official Launch**

_**TBD 2027**_ — Full deployment of **The Corporate Wars** with integrated gameplay, live services, and real governance activation.

The living economy begins, with players acting as full corporate entities within the interstellar economic system.
