# Designer Notes

### Bilanidin

**Bilanidin** is the official Vilani alphabet. In the Third Imperium, it shares official status with _Galanglic_ (Galactic English).\
There are [publications](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Vilani_Grammar_and_Glossary) on Vilani grammar and the use of Bilanidin, but the texts presented in this documentation and in the TCW's published materials have not been thoroughly reviewed and may contain errors.
