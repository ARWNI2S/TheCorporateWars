# Future Development

Beyond the current canon, there are multiple speculative and potential lines that could be explored in future phases of **The Corporate Wars** development. These are not announcements nor part of the immediate design, but open ideas for interpretation, analysis, and perhaps, implementation.

## Playable Droyne

Until now, the **Droyne** have served as a narrative element in the background of the universe. However, their ancestry, biological modularity, and direct connection to the Ancients make them ideal candidates to develop a completely different _Loyalty_, focused on ritual gameplay, genetic memory, and collective decisions.

> What if they were more than just an archaeological mystery?

## Pocket Empires

Inspired by classic mechanics, **Pocket Empires** proposes a modular expansion where players not only manage a _Politics_, but also build and scale their own _Loyalty_: with doctrines, symbols, hierarchical structures, and internal conflicts.

> A sandbox of personalized empires, where lore is written from the bottom up.

## Long Night

What happens if the game world enters a recession? If players abandon entire regions?  
**The Long Night** is a systemic possibility: an era of disuse simulated as economic collapse, imperial decline, or cultural rupture.

> It’s not a failure. It’s a scenario. One that can give rise to campaigns of restoration, interstellar archaeology, or rebirth from the ruins.

## Experiments

The blockchain-based infrastructure opens the door to exploring development paths that go far beyond mere state recording. Among the most advanced technical possibilities we are considering:

These lines are not part of the core design or the immediate official roadmap, but they are areas of active exploration that could redefine blockchain's potential in ecosystems focused exclusively on virtual worlds.

### Alternative timelines

Thanks to Solana's intrinsic versioning (proof-of-history + Merkle trees), it is technically possible to **fork at a historical point** and generate a divergent timeline, creating parallel environments.\
This would theoretically allow us to:

* create "what if..." scenarios,
* experiment with multiverse mechanics and **pocket universes**,
* or launch time-limited campaigns with alternative rulesets.

### Time travel simulation (gameified)

While not part of the Traveller™ canon, exploring the technical consequences of operating on historical snapshots —and the aforementioned forks— would allow us to model:

* missions that interact with past data,
* probabilistic forecasting systems,
* or even —_data archaeology_— mechanics, where recovering, reinterpreting, or even sabotaging past information alters the present.

### Applied sci-fi exploration

The technical ecosystem of **The Corporate Wars** is not limited to mimicking classic sci-fi canon; it enables us to raise cutting-edge questions:

* What does it mean to manipulate distributed consensus in a persistent universe?
* How far can a blockchain serve not just as a ledger, but as a simulator of possibilities?
* How can we integrate these ideas without breaking strategic coherence or game balance?
