# Traveller™

With the conclusion of the **Milieu 0** event, the system now has a functional, economic, and technical structural foundation: the initial _Policies_ have been deployed, the main routes established, and the first worlds structurally backed.

From here, a new historical and developmental phase begins — one that coincides with the **Second Survey**, encompassing the full *Traveller™* setting, not just the Third Imperium, but all the other _Allegiances_ of Charted Space.

> The **Second Survey** represents the systematic effort to chart the entirety of the Third Imperium and register the worlds not yet formally integrated into the central system.

This stage is directly inspired by the *Traveller™* canon and is set chronologically between the end of the **First Survey** —around the 6th century of the Third Imperium— and the main campaign setting of *Traveller™* —around the year 1115—, extending into its final stages until the year 1200, one year before the system's launch into production: 1201 of the Third Imperium.

While the **First Survey** (Milieu 0) focused on laying the technical, economic, and organizational groundwork of the simulated universe, the **Second Survey** marks the beginning of playable production: the universe can now be navigated, explored, and expanded through visual presence and active mechanics.

### Galactic Navigation Client

With the core infrastructure deployed, the **graphical game client** built in Unreal Engine begins rollout, initially with minimal navigation functionality:

- interactive visualization of the galactic map,
- basic movement across known sectors,
- surface-level planetary exploration,
- access to structural data on worlds and routes,
- and a function to report bugs —though we probably won’t need it ;).

> This module acts as a _Galactic Atlas_, allowing players to observe and freely navigate the already deployed scenario.

This client will serve as the foundation upon which the rest of the gameplay systems will be constructed.

## Second Survey

During the **Second Survey**, the process of registering all the worlds of Charted Space is completed.  
This includes:

- structural inclusion of worlds to complete the galactic map,
- distribution of the corresponding RU,
- technical anchoring of routes, governments, and local policies.

At the same time, the gradual rollout of the major _Allegiances_ beyond the Third Imperium begins:

- **Tlaukhu (Aslan Hierate)**,
- **Solomani Confederation** —For Terra!,
- **The Two Thousand Worlds (k'Kree)**,
- **Driantia Zhdantia (Zhodani Consulate)**,
- **The Federation (The Hive)**,
- **The Vargr Extents**,  
- and a long list of minor _Allegiances_ and client states among the interstellar powers.

Each will be integrated with its own _Policies_, systems of government, and distinct gameplay styles.

The event aims to align the content and gameplay of both new and existing systems with the broader lore of the *Traveller™* universe, in the era immediately preceding the _new milieu_ in which **The Corporate Wars** unfolds.

## Artistic Production and Visual Dynamics

Unlike the **First Survey**, where the priority was to test blockchain systems and validate economic infrastructure, the **Second Survey** focuses on:

- visual development of environments and ships,
- implementation of minimal interactive dynamics,
- modular construction of UI and HUD,
- animations and visual effects.

> This is the “artistic production and realization” phase. The system no longer just exists — it begins to be seen, felt, and traversed as a playable environment.

All audiovisual production will be aimed at achieving AAA-quality final output: animations, visual effects, textures, lighting, sound design, and soundtrack must embody the spirit of the *Traveller™* universe.

## The End of the Second Survey

The **Traveller™** event extends into the **Closed Beta** phase, where the full system will be tested as a complete, playable experience under uncontrolled real-world conditions.

By then, we’ll almost be done.
