# Historical Deployment Stages

**The Corporate Wars** is inspired by Traveller™, and throughout the design and early development we began to notice the strong —implicit or subjective— parallels it shares with certain technological aspects present in that universe.

The requirements keep piling up, the Solana network isn’t free, and the volume of information demands creative solutions.

## Imperial Chronology

The deployment plan was initially designed to support the provision of *rent* on the Solana network, integrating with the game's self-sustaining economy.

The original idea was to progressively roll out the worlds, initially self-funding the deployment of a sector or subsector, and later opening the expansion to the community: offering them ways to participate both in the unfolding of the galaxy and in supporting the game’s economy.

> ...more or less something like that. :P

The design of the game systems was progressively refined, incorporating aggregated governance systems, the use of historical trees to access outdated information, the zero-sum economy, and algorithmic stabilization systems.

At the same time, [Mongoose Publishing](http://www.mongoosepublishing.com/) notified us of their positive view of the project, which made everything make much more sense.

That’s why we have designed a staged deployment aligned with the chronology of the Third Imperium, from *Milieu 0* up to the current timeline of _**The Corporate Wars**_.

We want the community's participation in the system's deployment to reflect:
- the growth of the Third Imperium over time,
- the spheres of influence of the _loyalties_,
- of the _megacorporations_,
- and of the historically relevant _polities_.

Participation in the initial deployment of the systems is represented by real actors within the game system: the assets of the galaxy’s major powers and institutions.
