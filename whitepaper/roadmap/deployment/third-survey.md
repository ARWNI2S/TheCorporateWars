# The Corporate Wars

The final deployment phase corresponds to the **Closed Beta**.

The **Traveller™** event concludes with a map of the galaxy featuring several tens of thousands of star systems, stars, hundreds of thousands of planets, and a geometrically proportional number of jump routes.

Although the game's entities follow simple rules, complex systems often exhibit unexpected behavior that emerges from minimal variables compounded over time.

For this reason, we will subject the system to all kinds of stress tests and make it accessible to a fraction of players to validate its performance under real-world production scenarios.

### The Third Interstellar Survey

> This is a collaborative initiative led by the **Imperial Interstellar Scout Service**, together with interstellar entities such as the **Hakyeahtaorl**, the **Driantia Dazhia**, **SolSec**, and even the **Two Thousand Worlds**, alongside the private sector: a joint operation aimed at mapping not only known space, but also marginal worlds, forgotten frontiers, and the enclaves left behind during the Long Night.

At this stage of deployment, we are finalizing the details — leaving the system ready to play, with a AAA-quality client, high-performance services, robust bandwidth, and reinforced security.

The event itself will conclude with the final launch and full production release of **The Corporate Wars**, revealing new features and surprises reserved for the _next milieu_.
