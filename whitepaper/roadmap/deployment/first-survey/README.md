# Milieu 0

Historically, **Milieu 0** marks the starting point of the Third Imperium's expansion.

> It is the period immediately following its foundation, when Cleon Zhunastu, the First Emperor, unified the worlds inherited from a —reunified— Ziru Sirka and began consolidating real power over a fragmented galaxy.

It is an age of exploration, diplomacy, infrastructure building, the establishment of communication routes, and negotiation of allegiances with peripheral sectors and worlds�laying the foundations upon which the Imperium would grow over the next thousand years.

### Initial Deployment

At first, the system presents basic infrastructure requirements:

* backend servers,
* websites,
* RPC nodes,
* and on-chain programs on the Solana network.

All of them can be deployed in test environments —either cloud-based or local— and with stateless programs operating on _Devnet_.

Test suites validate code effectiveness, and closed UX testing validates the production-readiness of this first deployment stage.

For this, we rely on an MVP containing the following systems:

* administrative management of the Charted Space map,
* treasury for the economic system,
* the multi-layer governance structure,
* _Policies_ as game and governance entities,
* the interstellar financial system.

## Community Participation

At this early stage, there is no functional game client, but fully developed Solana programs are already in place that define the core structures of the game system.

Participants at this stage contribute SOL to the system treasury in exchange for **MCr** and **RU** bundles, which are injected into the game economy via the already implemented interstellar financial system.

The system **treasury** is responsible for:

* enabling the minting of **MCr** and **RU**,
* covering _rent_ deposits for all system PDAs,
* maintaining operational costs,
* rewarding developer and artist contributions,
* and potentially enabling future **MCr** liquidity on external markets.

At this stage, the interstellar financial system simulates:

* participation in _megacorporations_, _corporations_, and other _Policies_,
* the major holdings of the _Imperial Bank_,
* the _Route Options_ of the _Interstellar Stock Exchange_,
* the great fortunes of the _Nobiliti_.

### _Policies_ in Milieu 0

The _Policy_ system, already structured, allows for:

* the creation of primary _Allegiances_ and interstellar _Policies_,
* the creation of _governments_ affiliated with _Allegiances_,
* the creation of _megacorporations_ as aggregates of _Policies_,
* and the creation of individual _corporations_.

These _Policies_ will persist as historical game entities, outside the direct control of players, but with direct impact on mechanics related to _allegiances_, _governments_, _law_, and _macro-economic structures_.

### Exploration and Expansion

Various contributions to the economic system build a network of worlds and jump routes around Sylea.

RUs are distributed within the system in a balanced way, progressively accumulating on each world.

The first phases are focused solely on Sylea, reinforcing its position as the Capital of the Imperium.

The accumulated RU implies SOL in the treasury, which enables route deployment as PDA, but to deploy a route, we first need a destination —therefore it becomes the responsibility of the "Sylean stack" to pay the _rent_ for the PDAs of nearby worlds and routes.

This mechanism literally and structurally lays the groundwork for the galactic maps that players will explore centuries later.

> It allows us to establish the foundations for exploring new sectors of the galaxy and simulating the expansion of the Imperium and its interstellar routes.

Each world acts as a node, and each route as an edge in an asymmetric, bidirectional neural network.

## Conclusion of the Event

The **Milieu 0** event concludes, as a participatory phase, once all initial _Policies_ have been deployed —worlds, jump routes, _Allegiances_, _Institutions_, and functional systems projected under the **First Survey**.

The system will then present a solid initial set of entities, consistent with the historical milestones of the _Traveller_™ universe, and ready for the next stage of development —and expansion.
