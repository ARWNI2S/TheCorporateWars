# Interactive Causality

In game theory, interactive causality describes systems where individual decisions not only produce immediate effects but also propagate over time, modifying the context, available strategies, and collective dynamics.

This approach allows for modeling not only isolated outcomes but also trajectories of interaction, adaptation, and persistence.

Among the areas that address these dynamics are:

* **Repeated games**, where actors face successive versions of the same game, allowing past decisions to condition future expectations and strategies.
* **Evolutionary games**, which study how certain behavioral patterns proliferate or disappear depending on their relative performance in adaptive environments.
* **Reputation games**, where past actions accumulate weight, affecting the credibility, influence, or strategic position of the actors.
* **Learning games**, where participants progressively adjust their decisions based on partial information, environmental signals, or observable behaviors.

The theoretical interest in these structures lies in their ability to generate non-trivial patterns: phenomena such as spontaneous cooperation, collective collapse, cycles of trust and betrayal, or emergent dynamics that cannot be explained through static or pointwise analysis.

### Partial Information and Learning

In learning games, actors do not have perfect or complete information about environmental conditions or the strategies of others.

Instead, they build expectations and adapt their decisions based on partial observations, indirect signals, perceived patterns, and accumulated outcomes.

This type of model allows for analyzing how dynamics of adjustment, exploration, and refinement emerge in systems where total knowledge is unattainable.

## Modeling and Implementation

In **The Corporate Wars**, interactive causality manifests in how _Polities_ react and adapt to a mutable environment.

Decisions are not isolated: they affect resource availability, alter power structures, modify trade routes, and reconfigure alliances.

As actors interact, the system accumulates memory of their movements, generating a dynamic fabric of consequences that transcends each individual action and contributes to the evolution of the galactic scenario.

### Outdated Information

Available information circulates and is retransmitted asymmetrically and partially: communications degrade, routes are uncertain, and signals arrive incomplete or biased by local filters.

_Polities_ do not respond to a perfect image of the environment but to fragments, echoes, and interpretations they receive, process, and use to define their moves.

This layer of uncertainty turns each decision not just into a response to the known but into continuous learning in the face of the unknown.
