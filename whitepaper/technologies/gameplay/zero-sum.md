# Zero-Sum Economic Game

The zero-sum economic game defines a scenario where interactions between actors keep the system’s overall magnitude constant.

Transformations emerging across its multiple levels do not modify the total volume of the environment but instead continuously reorganize it, preserving a balance that relies not on accumulation, expansion, or reduction, but on movement within a defined framework.

### Theoretical Principle

A zero-sum game is a model in which, for any combination of participants’ choices, changes in their states are exactly compensated, so that the total variation in the system remains null.

Formally:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n r_i(s) = 0
$$

where:
- n = number of players,
- s = selected strategy profile,
- $$r_i(s)$$ = outcome (position, influence, presence...) of player _i_

### Implementation

In **The Corporate Wars**, this principle frames the game as an interactive system where constant exchanges between _polities_ take place within controlled boundaries.

Although their forms, intensities, and expressions may vary, the overall scale of interaction remains constant.

It is a system that absorbs and redistributes movements, sustaining a balance that does not rely on increase or decrease, but on the continuous unfolding of its own dynamics.

High-level entities — supervisors and overseers — apply shared routines to maintain the general balance.

These entities manifest, and can be engaged with interactively, through the system’s aggregated _polities_: _Allegiances_, _Institutions_, and _Governments_.

> In practice, this translates into micro-adjustments within the economic game: taxes, tariffs, duties, fees, prices, and other mechanisms that modulate systemic behavior without altering its global scale.
