# Community-Driven Deployment

The architecture of **The Corporate Wars** system is based on complex systems principles, applying consolidated academic models that enable the progressive, modular, and decoupled deployment of the _stateless blockchain_ environment across stages.

Community participation drives this process, integrating layers of interaction that do not alter the universe's predefined foundations but activate and contextualize them according to participant availability and progression.

### _Polities_, _Worlds_, and _Jump Routes_

Imperial nobility, duchies, megacorporations, and other high-level entities are historical elements already defined within the game's background.

Community deployment does not create or alter them; it progressively incorporates them into the simulation, allowing participants to interact with them as they become available, and recording those interactions as part of the system's persistent historical memory.

Each new layer —worlds, jump routes, institutions, historical actors— is deployed respecting the original setting, with its predefined structures, offering participants interaction spaces determined by availability, not improvisation.

This design ensures that the _rent_ deposits required for the deployment of game structures remain scalable and balanced with community participation across the various development stages.

Thus, deployment not only activates worlds, routes, and power structures: it builds the very historical map of the galaxy.

It defines allegiances and hierarchies, within a persistent timeline that will remain interactive in-game.

Participants in the deployment stages do not merely hold a place in the game, but in the living memory of its evolution.
