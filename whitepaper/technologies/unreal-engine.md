# Unreal Engine

Unreal Engine (UE) is a next-generation, cross-platform engine for AAA development, simulation, and multi-layered projects like **The Corporate Wars**.

{% hint style="success" %}
UE provides graphical power, modularity, flexible backend, and customizable editor tools that enable **The Corporate Wars** to build, scale, and deliver a persistent galactic strategy experience, with blockchain integration and commercial presence on the Epic Games Store.
{% endhint %}

***

## Key Points

* **Multiplatform**: PC, Linux, dedicated servers.
* **Modularity**: only activates needed systems, optimizing resources.
* **Blueprints + C++**: fast visual programming + full code control.

### Backend & Architecture

UE allows client-server architecture with dedicated Unreal servers or custom backend, key for a persistent RTS like TCW where classic matchmaking is unnecessary but world state control and synchronization are essential.

### Custom Editor Tools

Unreal enables development of custom editor tools (editor tools, runtime editors, plugins) to build, modify, and maintain dynamic systems. In TCW, these tools are fundamental to generate and manage the persistent galaxy, populating it with entities, events, and ecosystems evolving in real time.

### Web3 Integration (Solana)

Though experimental, there are SDKs enabling wallet integration, NFTs, SPL tokens, and on-chain operations, aligning with TCW's blockchain layer for registry, distributed governance, or asset management.

***

## Epic Games Store

**The Corporate Wars** will be distributed on Epic Games Store, leveraging:

* Direct game or special package sales.
* Optional access to microtransactions.
* Exposure on a global marketplace, though not the primary channel.

### Marketplace & Community

The Unreal Marketplace offers assets, plugins, and tools to accelerate development. The Epic community provides support, documentation, and examples to optimize the team's work.
