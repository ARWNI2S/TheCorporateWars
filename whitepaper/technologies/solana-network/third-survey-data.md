# Third Survey Database

The Third Survey is the structural core of the simulated universe in **The Corporate Wars**.

It is not a simple catalog of planets or a route map, but an active, decentralized, and asynchronous database that models the physical and logical elements of known space.

It defines what exists, what is connected, and who can exert authority over what.

Information is not static: it evolves over time, is transmitted partially, and experiences delay based on actual data flow.

This behavior is not a narrative device, but a direct consequence of the model itself: worlds, routes, and power structures are stored, processed, and updated within program-derived accounts (PDAs) anchored to specific programs.

## Worlds as dynamic nodes

Each world is a program-derived account (PDA), whose content is compressed into a Merkle Tree representing a **dehydrated profile** of the planet—essential data encoded efficiently and verifiably.

This includes population, technological level, legal regime, estimated GDP, form of government, climate, and other key attributes.

In addition, each world maintains a **version history**. Instead of overwriting its state, every change is stored as a difference (_diff_) from the previous version, allowing its evolution to be precisely reconstructed at any point in the past.

These worlds do not exist in isolation: they are connected by routes that determine not only physical transit, but also access to updated information, valid orders, and applicable authority.

## Routes, visibility, and governance

**Jump routes** are program-derived accounts that represent _all functional connections between worlds_. They record latency, traffic volume, operational conditions, and active restrictions.

They are technical entities, but also political ones: they enable or block the transmission of orders, goods, data, and power.

The system simulates an **asynchronous and partially visible** universe. Each world sees only what has been transmitted through its active routes.

There is no instant global truth: two worlds may hold different versions of the same event, depending on their position in the topological graph and the delay in information propagation.

This logic faithfully reproduces the physical limits of interstellar communication.

***

Operating on top of this framework are the _Polities_—the system’s governance entities.

None of them can exert authority in the abstract: they require **controlled worlds** and **operational routes** to reach them.

Without that infrastructure validated by the system, their capacity for action is null or merely symbolic. Authority depends on topology: nothing is governed where nothing can be reached.

Moreover, the whole system is alive. Worlds may be founded, conquered, terraformed, abandoned, or destroyed.

Routes may close, degrade, or reopen through diplomatic decisions, systemic events, or technological shifts.

All of this is recorded and reflected in the programmatic accounts of the Third Survey.

***

In summary, the Third Survey does not merely describe the universe: it defines it.  
It is the ontological foundation of the game.  
What is not in the Third Survey does not exist.  
And what is not updated is uncertain.
