# Dynamic Dependencies

In **The Corporate Wars**, the ecosystem of player relationships can be structured around a model of functional dependencies that reflects complex, scalable, and emergent corporate dynamics.

This system allows for the strategic distribution of power, resources, and responsibilities, generating voluntary or forced subordination relationships between players and entities.

***

By analogy and inspiration, we can express these _dynamic governance dependencies_ as an evolution of the _scholarship player model_ from P2E games —not as a intent of enforcing this kind of dynamic, but due to its natural emergence within the governance system.

*   **Manager**\
    The _Manager_ is the actor who owns or controls key assets: licenses, facilities, grants, governance structures, or technologies.\
    They may have reached a strategic level where direct involvement is no longer necessary or desirable.

    They act as investor, regulator, or operational architect of other players' actions, offering access to their resources under specific conditions.
*   **Scholar**\
    The _Scholar_ is the player who operates assets they do not directly own.\
    They utilize infrastructure, permissions, or third-party resources, sharing benefits with their parent entity.

    Their activity may be supervised, regulated, or incentivized through contracts, allegiances, or formal dependency.

> This model enables new or specialized players to participate in complex operations without requiring an initial investment.

#### Split

In this model, **Split** represents the agreement on revenue sharing and can be structured in various ways:

* Performance-based dividends
* Internal taxes or operational fees
* Automatic returns to the parent entity
* Evaluation and sanction mechanisms
* Mandatory political or military contributions

## Emerging Scenarios

Applying the _scholarship player model_ over the _multi-layer governance system_ enables the emergence of advanced situations:

* **Corporate escalation:** a player may evolve from _Scholar_ to _Manager_ by expanding their structure and starting to subsidize others.
* **Chains of subordination:** _Policies_ can structure complex dependency networks among their members.
* **Forced transformations:** a corporation can be absorbed through hostile takeover, military conquest, or diplomatic domination, converting its players into _Scholars_ within a new structure.
* **Loss of autonomy:** a player may become dependent after a financial crisis, military defeat, or institutional reorganization, while still remaining active.

***

In **The Corporate Wars**, dependencies are not limits —they are vectors of transformation.\
Each link —voluntary or forced— creates unique trajectories within the metagame, where power is not measured only in assets, but in the ability to weave networks, climb hierarchies, and redraw the rules from within the system.
