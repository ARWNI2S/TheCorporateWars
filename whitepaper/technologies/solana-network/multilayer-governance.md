# Multilayer Governance

Governance in **The Corporate Wars** is not a monolithic system, but a superposition of functional layers that reflect the complexity of political, economic, and operational power in the game universe.

In this model, each actor —whether an AI, a player-run corporation, or a transgalactic institution— operates within a defined normative framework, compatible with the rest of the system through a shared architecture built on the Solana network.

> From millennia-old empires to orbital communes, all levels of organization are structured across three major layers of governance: global, aggregate, and individual.

{% hint style="info" %}
These are not traditional hierarchical levels, but dimensions of authority that operate simultaneously and define the scope and nature of every decision.
{% endhint %}

### The **Global Layer**

Establishes the foundational laws of the simulated universe.

It covers universal regulations: immutable physical laws, interstellar tax frameworks, temporal synchronization between sectors, inflation control, access to finite resources, or the delimitation of routes.

This layer is entirely controlled by the game AI and forms the invisible skeleton upon which the rest of the simulation is built.

It is not negotiable nor manipulable, but it is observable, predictable, and usable by advanced players.

### The **Aggregate Governance Layer**

Encompasses all collective entities that represent institutional, political, or doctrinal power over multiple actors.

> _Allegiances_ such as the Third Imperium, the Two Thousand Worlds, or the Zhodani Consulate; institutions like ministries, fleets, or ancestral clans; alliances between corporations or ideological movements — all are aggregates.

Most are governed by the AI, though they can be influenced internally through meritocratic structures or external pressure.

Aggregates modulate and mediate the action of individual entities, setting doctrines, regulations, and hierarchies of access to power, knowledge, or capital.

### The **Individual Layer**

Corresponds to the operational actors of the system: planetary governments, corporations, cultures, religions, political parties, or any other autonomous organization.

These entities —controlled by players or AI— make local decisions, manage resources, declare conflicts, establish settlements, and define their own internal regulations.

They operate within the framework defined by the upper layers, but retain enough autonomy to develop unique strategies, formulate doctrines, or even challenge the established order.

## noNFT

{% hint style="success" %}
**noNFTs** represent the fundamental governance assets.
{% endhint %}

Unlike traditional NFTs —focused on individual ownership and marketable transferability—, noNFTs in _The Corporate Wars_ function as **structural tokens tied to governance entities in the game** (_Polities_), with dynamic and auditable attributes.

A noNFT is not an image nor a collectible: it is a **coded representation of power**, linked to a _Polity_ (corporation, government, clan, federation, etc.).

Each is stored in a **PDA derived from the governance program**, and its validity depends on:

- the public key of the _Polity_;
- the type of authority it represents (legislative, executive, operational, etc.);
- the date and context of issuance;
- its legal status (active, suspended, transferred, revoked, etc.).

Technically, noNFTs do not use the standard Solana model where each NFT requires its own individual _mint_ (1:1).

Instead, the **entire noNFT system relies on a single shared** _**mint**_, from which accounts are derived per _Polity_.

These accounts —analogous to an extended ATA— store the corresponding noNFTs along with the minimum operational metadata required for validation and use.

This allows, for example:

- delegating facility usage permissions;
- granting temporary exploitation licenses;
- establishing internal voting hierarchies for elections or reforms;
- validating interstellar contracts between _Polities_ without external oracles.

Technically, each noNFT behaves like a **programmatic metadata account**, not dependent on visual standards like traditional NFTs.

Its design leverages Solana’s architecture to ensure traceability, compression, and parallel decision execution.

Furthermore, since they are not marketable individual objects, noNFTs **cannot be speculated on or resold** outside the game, reinforcing their function as true governance instruments, not volatile-value items.

Lastly, a single _Polity_ may hold multiple noNFTs, representing different roles or functions: from the board of directors of a megacorporation to the local delegates of an autonomous enclave.

***

> This model enables decision-making, internal reforms, and legal disputes to be resolved **within the game universe itself**, without external intervention or the need for parallel systems.

{% hint style="warning" %}
noNFTs, combined with multilayer governance, make it possible to simulate a rich, coherent, and believable future ruled by humans, aliens... and protocols.
