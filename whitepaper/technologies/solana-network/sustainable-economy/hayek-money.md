# Algorithmical Balance

The interstellar economy of **The Corporate Wars** is built upon advanced algorithmic stabilization mechanisms, inspired by contemporary experiments with algorithmic stablecoins—particularly Hayek Money—and reimagined as centuries of Vilani engineering, refined by the Core AIs.

From a technical perspective, these systems allow for the dynamic adjustment of the galactic monetary base, maintaining the purchasing power of the MegaCredit (MCr) against aggregated fluctuations, without manual intervention or centralized authority.

This translates into an economic simulation ecosystem where monetary stability is a reliable backdrop: an invisible foundation upon which players, corporations, and institutions can build, compete, and evolve.

It is not a direct gameplay mechanism nor an exploitable resource: it is the ground upon which the entire universe breathes.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Algorithmically stabilized tokens are an experimental and evolving technology. While a solid theoretical foundation exists, there are few practical implementations.\
The **perceived** risk of **algorithmic stablecoin** projects —and similar mechanisms— is, in practical terms, comparable to participating in any cryptocurrency market: it appears higher only because these systems lack the pyramidal capitalization typical of tokens without a real project or underlying costs.

The benefit lies in the _success_ of the project itself, **not in a promised return** —which could only be guaranteed through a pyramid-based contribution scheme.

## Fundamental Principles

The game's economic core is designed to emulate the realistic behavior of markets, where coordination between actors does not depend on a central authority but on distributed signals like prices.

**The Corporate Wars** simulates how these signals arise, how they are distorted by informational delays, and how they generate opportunities for both cooperation and competition among players.

### Hayekian Model

Inspired by the economic principles of F. A. Hayek, **The Corporate Wars** portrays prices as local information signals that allow planetary economies to adapt incrementally.

There is no predefined global equilibrium: each star system reacts to its own supply and demand, creating an environment of constant, partial, and condition-dependent adjustments.

{% hint style="success" %}
This approach fits perfectly with the monetary philosophy of the Third Imperium, a direct heir to the Vilani practices of the Ziru Sirka.\
&#xNAN;_&#x41;lliegances_ does not seek to impose absolute centralized control but to maintain a common reference framework —like the MegaCredit (MCr)— that allows diverse worlds to interact, trade, and compete under the same economic architecture.
{% endhint %}

### Market Flows

At the heart of the galactic economy are trade routes that channel not only goods but also prices, signals, **information**.

The economic currents inspiring this model—decentralized, self-regulating, alternative to centralized control schools—hold that it is unnecessary to intervene at every node.

According to Hayek, the key is to understand how signals flow, how supply and demand interact across trade routes, and how this constant movement generates aggregated dynamics of balance.

In **The Corporate Wars**, this principle is embodied in interstellar routes, acting as macroeconomic vectors over local markets, propagating tensions, and redistributing imbalances.

### Synthetic Equilibrium

In the economic model of **The Corporate Wars**, planetary systems are modeled as nodes interconnected through interstellar trade routes, forming a network of high topological complexity.

Alterations at any node—whether productive, polítical, or technological—modify the traffic patterns of its routes, generating events that propagate across the system according to the density of interstellar traffic.

This type of propagation does not seek to homogenize states or achieve uniform equilibrium.

What emerges is a **synthetic equilibrium**: a dynamic state of continuous adjustment, where local tensions are redistributed across the network, allowing the whole to maintain an optimal operational balance.

The greater the network density and connectivity, the higher its capacity to absorb local disturbances, dampen systemic effects, and create space for new economic configurations.

***

## Control Mechanisms

The control mechanisms in **The Corporate Wars** are distributed processes that absorb disturbances, redistribute tensions, and balance flows continuously, presenting interaction through local events, sectoral news, and the propagation of information across systems.

These mechanisms do not operate as external interventions but as part of the ecosystem’s emergent behavior, generating dynamics that affect both the economic structure and local perceptions within the simulated universe.

### Inflows and Outflows

The monetary balance in **The Corporate Wars** depends on the inflows and outflows of **MCr**, allowing the circulating money supply to adjust dynamically according to market conditions.

Inflows (emissions, incentives, rewards) and outflows (fees, licenses, liquidity absorptions) do not have isolated impacts: they are compensated by market flows, which redistribute monetary pressure, help maintain the purchasing power of **MCr** within an operationally stable range, and generate gameplay events that, in turn, trigger new cycles of inflows and outflows.

This model not only preserves the coherence of the economic ecosystem but transforms it into a dynamic environment where each adjustment opens opportunities, risks, and strategic decisions.

### Automated Propagation

The natural system of **The Corporate Wars** functions as a self-regulating network: regions with high economic activity keep their prices adjusted through the effects of inflows and outflows, while less active regions balance themselves indirectly through the propagation of signals across the network, with delays and attenuation depending on distance and traffic intensity.

In algorithmic terms, prices tend toward a desired value:

$$
P_{desired} = P_{current} × \bigg(1 + α × \frac{(D - S)}{S}\bigg)
$$

where:

* D is local demand,
* S is local supply,
* α is the sensitivity coefficient.

Additionally, the model incorporates a distributed balance adjustment:

$$
ΔP = Σ (w_n × (P_n - P_{current}))
$$

where:

* $$P_n$$ are the prices of neighboring nodes,
* $$w_n$$ is the weight of each connection based on traffic and latency.

This combination allows the system to maintain global coherence without direct intervention or manual supervision, generating a balance that adapts to both active centers and less trafficked margins.
