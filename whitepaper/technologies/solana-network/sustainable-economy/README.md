# Self-Sustainable Economy

> **The Corporate Wars** is the first real-time galactic simulation whose economic model is part of the gameplay, and is designed from scratch to sustain itself without investors, pre-mines, or future promises.

The design starts from a premise: the infrastructure required for any quality online game is, simply put, expensive and costly to maintain.

Throughout the life cycle of a video game —except perhaps in its initial design and basic development phases� expenses are incurred, increasing proportionally to the scope of the project.

**The Corporate Wars** is designed as a holistic, self-sufficient ecosystem, able to develop rapidly and maintain its lifecycle for years.

This means that the system�s economy �both in terms of in-game function and technical operation� must be capable of financing itself without relying on speculative methods.

### Real Economic Sustainability

The volume of maintenance and operational requirements is not infinite, but quantifiable and scalable: the actual activity of users determines the system�s current needs.

On the other hand, although development may rely on �altruistic collaborators,� the truth is that this model alone won�t reach the desired quality or development pace.

> Many collaborative projects started strong, but their progress is slow, sometimes taking more than a decade to reach production stages.

The project's financial architecture is proposed as a participatory model designed to guarantee technical self-sufficiency independent of speculative profits or investment guarantees:

All **SOL** entering the system (player participation, donations, external investment, etc.) is routed to programmatic treasuries and considered part of the simulation � integrated into the game experience.

These treasuries fund:

* the maintenance of active accounts (�_rent_�),
* the network usage fees for the backend,
* development and maintenance costs,
* and the system�s general operation (infrastructure, computation, data validation, etc...).

This sustainability not only guarantees the system�s technical continuity, but reinforces the central premise of The Corporate Wars: a persistent, dynamic, and authentically simulated universe.

## Economy and Gameplay

The economic design of _The Corporate Wars_ is not a _funding method_, nor is it _P2E_, nor any kind of _crypto construct_: **it is the game system itself**, which accounts for real operational costs and adopts the user experience of common monetization methods in games as a provisioning interface.

We rethink the concept of _game marketplace_, integrating it with the causality, persistence, and scale of the game universe, where all purchases are part of the _lore_ and the participatory economic mechanics of the system.

The self-sustaining model not only ensures the viability of a persistent universe but also **directly modulates the gameplay experience**:

*   A massive influx of players or funds increases liquidity: **funding pools expand**, new accounts are activated, latent programs are deployed, and previously abandoned star systems are reactivated.

    > Over time, this may trigger a **galactic boom**, accompanied by visible events, improved financial conditions in-game, etc.
*   Conversely, if a faction loses influence, a holding withdraws, or there is an exodus of megacredit stakes, the system may respond: reducing assigned _rent_, consolidating accounts, or terminating inactive ones.

    > This deterioration leads to a **visible economic contraction** from within gameplay.

The global economic situation affects the system with tangible effects on:

* Strategic decisions of AI-controlled actors (_Allegiances_, _Institutions_, _megacorporations_).
* The purchasing power of simulated currencies.
* The **capacity for territorial or technological expansion**.
* Access to services, licenses, or concessions.
* The relative value of the system�s SPL tokens.

The system responds with internal logic: there is no magic, only consequences.

* If no one maintains an account�s _rent_, data is lost.
* If a _Polity_ withdraws its _stakes_, it loses power.
* If a _Polity_ overextends, it may collapse.
* If a _Polity_ runs out of funds, it will fall.
* If the whole structure collapses, we may enter a _Long Night_ scenario.

Yet even without operational resources, the system should remain playable � for players isolated from the rest of the galaxy, disconnected from interstellar routes (servers) � until a new _Allegiance_ emerges, reconnecting routes and worlds into a structured system... and makes contact.

Thus, players are not only competing for points, territory, or narrative progression, but to **sustain a living, fragile ecosystem**, where every credit, contract, and economic cycle has a real impact with systemic consequences.
