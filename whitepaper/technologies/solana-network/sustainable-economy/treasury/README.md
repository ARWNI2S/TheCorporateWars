# Game Treasury

The Treasury is the component responsible for sustaining the economic infrastructure of **The Corporate Wars**, both within the simulated universe and in its real technical implementation.

It manages the SOL funds required to operate on the Solana network —including storage, fees, and account maintenance— but also covers costs associated with the development, deployment, and maintenance of the system as a whole.

This includes cloud servers, local environments, integration tools, and —especially relevant— the work of the people building the project: programmers, designers, artists, validators, and collaborators.

It is integrated as a programmatic entity within the game contracts, but its impact extends to the entire system: a well-funded treasury allows the system to scale, adjusting to user activity in real time.

The Treasury interprets the universe's activity as a set of objective metrics (number of active players, transaction volume, route usage, economic cycles, etc.) and adjusts resources dynamically.

More activity, more resource allocation; less activity, secondary systems are deactivated, processing frequencies are reduced, or higher-use nodes are prioritized: the system does not collapse immediately, but degrades progressively following controlled patterns.

### Treasury Flows

Community participation is the main inflow of SOL to the Treasury; it consists of external contributions to the system, integrated as playable dynamics, simulated and embedded in the historical background of the game universe.

Each relevant action —such as exploring a world, registering a trade route, modifying a _Policy_ or founding an _Allegiance_— generates inflows that are redirected to the Treasury.

Some of these flows come from the _marketplace_, with temporary effects, consumables, and redistributable assets through algorithmic stabilization.

Others come from community events, such as historical deployment phases, which build technical databases on the Solana network while generating persistent historical background for participants.

The inflows are programmatically allocated to configurable prioritized reserves, determining how much is needed, for what, and with what frequency and relevance.

All surpluses are redirected to a technical _liquidity reserve_ fund for the whole.

## Outflows

The Treasury is not aimed at profit or accumulation: its purpose is to sustain the ecosystem, keeping it active, functional, and in constant evolution.

This implies automatic outflows to cover internal system costs —_rent_ and _fees_— while the rest is intended to ensure the operational and technical continuity of the project.

Allocation criteria are either coded, where applicable, or defined by the project's economic design at other layers.

If an account needs to increase its _rent_, an allocation process is triggered.

If a subsystem requires deployment or support, it is covered.

If excess pressure or lack of liquidity is detected in a part of the ecosystem, the Treasury can intervene.

It acts according to clear rules and serves as a point of connection between the system's internal needs and the real resources that make its existence possible.
