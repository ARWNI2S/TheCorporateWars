# Liquidity Pools

The Liquidity Pools are internal structures of the Treasury that manage the system's programmatic SOL reserves.

Their function is not to accumulate capital, but to ensure the continuous operation of **The Corporate Wars**, even under adverse conditions or periods of low participation.

Rather than being centralized in a single vault, the funds are organized by functionality: operating costs, technical contingency, scaling transitions, subsidies, or coverage of automated contracts. Each operates under specific rules and can be dynamically adjusted according to system activity.

When the ecosystem generates more resources than it consumes, part of the surplus may be assigned to structural backup reserves. These reserves allow, for example, maintaining minimum services, sustaining degraded regions, or ensuring development continuity during periods of recession.

In more advanced phases, certain funds may channel part of their liquidity into external interaction mechanisms —such as the conversion of MCr in markets— as long as the economic autonomy and technical sustainability of the system are not compromised.

Each fund is integrated into the economic architecture as an autonomous subsystem, regulated by configurable parameters and supervised by the programmatic logic of the Treasury.

> Their existence is not the result of passive accumulation, but of the need to provide the system with a **consistent economic infrastructure**, capable of adapting to cycles, sustaining itself during contraction, and expanding in a controlled manner.
