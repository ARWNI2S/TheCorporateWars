# Development Funding

**The Corporate Wars** is a system under construction whose technical architecture —programmatic contracts, treasury, economic and political structure� is already implemented at its core, but the playable universe has not yet been born.

This is a production reality: building a living environment requires resources. Without speculative phases or future promises, the elements that connect internal logic to player experience �visual client, interfaces, real-time validations, minimum playable cycle� must be developed with professional quality.

### Initial Production

No complex system emerges spontaneously without a continuous investment of technical, artistic, and operational work. The initial production needs structure, direction, tools, and _people_.

Development funding does not aim to create a finished product, but to reach a functional starting point.

During **Community Deployment** events, the _minimum viable game_ begins on-chain and extends to the client. But for that to make sense, it must be built with purpose, intention, and a technical foundation that guarantees its coherence.

Every contribution received in this initial phase is allocated to making the system visible, usable, and expandable.

Each developed segment activates subsystems, reinforces the economic cycle, and allows progress without depending on unpredictable external income.

## Lifecycle

The application lifecycle of **The Corporate Wars** requires continuous investment in development: new functionalities, system expansions, administrative tools, technical improvements, content design, interfaces, events, and emergent systems.

This layer of work encompasses everything necessary for the project to evolve: from writing code to designing new mechanics, illustrating worlds, testing integrations, documenting functionalities, or adapting the backend to new requirements.

***

The Treasury allocates part of its funds to sustain these processes gradually, starting incrementally to meet the initial demands of production.

It may allocate resources to internal development cycles, short-term hires, specialized tasks, or external collaborations.

The goal is to keep the system in constant evolution, without relying on external funding or unpredictable income spikes.

This self-funding policy allows steady, modular, and verifiable progress.

Each improvement, each new technical or playable capability, is built on the foundation of what already exists, using the resources generated by the system itself.
