# SPL Tokens

**The Corporate Wars** uses two SPL tokens deployed on the Solana network as the technical foundation of its simulated economy.

These tokens represent two very different types of value within the system:

* **RU** —Resource Units— are structural SPL tokens that represent the _macroeconomic weight_ of worlds, and are not designed to be transferred outside the game system.
* **MCr** —MegaCredits— are designed to circulate freely among users as an in-game currency.

> The system, in its economic simulation based on **zero-sum games** and **Hayekian algorithmic stabilization**, is structurally translated into a route graph that uses SPL tokens —economic-financial instruments— as nodal weights, modulating the system's dynamics: where RU is deposited, there is exploitable structural wealth; where **MCr** is staked, there is immediate financial liquidity.

They share the same technical infrastructure: both are standard SPL assets on the Solana network.

However, their behavior is governed by the game's internal programs, which define what can be transferred, what can be exchanged, and what only holds validity within the system itself.

This architecture ensures that the gameplay of the simulated economic system remains coherent and verifiable, without breaking technical interoperability with the outside world.
