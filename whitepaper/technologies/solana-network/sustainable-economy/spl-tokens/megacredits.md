# MegaCredits

**MegaCredits** are transferable SPL tokens that function as a unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value within the economic system of **The Corporate Wars**.

They are designed to circulate freely both inside and outside the game, stored in external wallets, transferred between users, and used in smart contracts deployed on the Solana network.

Within the simulated universe, their existence is justified as a financial instrument issued by the **Interstellar Stock Exchange (ISE)** and integrated into the game's rules as a long-range economic resource —macroeconomic— that _Allegiances_ use to support their financial _Institutions_.

## Community Participation

Their primary role focuses on community participation: by using MCr as the _"main currency"_ of the economic simulation, we can maintain incoming flows convertible to a SOL-equivalent weighted by the Treasury system.

Players receive MCr as compensation for their contribution to the system. The amount of MCr assigned depends on their punctual contribution, total accumulated input, and the system's operational needs.

When urgent funds are required, the system thanks —and incentivizes— community participation through variable bonuses to the MCr usually awarded.

If the system receives a healthy inflow of SOL, it returns to the calculated **compensatory equilibrium**.

To avoid SOL flow cycles orchestrated by player groups trying to _artificially trigger incentives_, the system in **compensatory equilibrium** will offer additional randomized rewards, potentially cumulative, in the form of playable assets or emergent events that grant long-term benefits.

This aims to prevent distortions in game balance caused by indiscriminate inflows —or outflows— of MCr: all flows are regulated through playable dynamics, structured as collaborative strategies, managed by a game AI subsystem whose main objective is to "_play to finance the game_" while maintaining narrative coherence in the simulation.

### Institutional Stake

MCr acts as **institutional stake** in the system. _Policies_ with a minimum financial scope maintain MCr stakes within the Interstellar Stock Exchange; the stake amounts affect the legitimacy, operational capacity, and persistence of those _Policies_ within the Zero-Sum Economic Simulation.

The community participation system encourages MCr staking to provide financial backing to specific _Policies_ —primarily _Allegiances_ and _Institutions_— controlled by AI.

This backing is not directed support to one particular _Policy_, but is distributed horizontally by the system to prevent imbalances not anticipated by gameplay, lore, or the Stabilization Algorithm.

It also allows for regulated backing of player-run _Policies_, enabling _guilds_ and _alliances_ to create their own macroeconomic and governance structures, with capitalization limits defined by gameplay mechanics.

Player contributions to these _stakes_ provide direct and persistent gameplay benefits: simulated values —shares, actions, diplomatic relations, public image, etc.— that become part of the player's _corporate legacy_ and will be rendered in-game when narrative dynamics call for it.

### Macroeconomic Liquidity

Players may use MCr as **macroeconomic liquidity** directly in the Interstellar Stock Exchange, which offers a wide range of instruments based on **Resource Units (RU)**, _Route Bonds_, and various shares, participations, and investment funds.

The result in-game is the intervention of local financial _Policies_ with institutional backing from the ISE, supporting large-scale operations, speculative trade route investments, or even founding _Policies_ —corporate governments, alliances, trusts, holdings, or even _Allegiances_.

ISE participants gain access to system functionalities not available to players without liquidity in the Exchange.

MCr used for **macroeconomic liquidity** may originate either from in-game sources —corporate profits— or externally —wallet deposits—, in which case contributions are limited by the community participation quota offered by the ISE.

These offers represent a persistent _corporate legacy_ in the form of _opportunities_ from local economies, offered to corporations that maintain balanced public image, government relations, and fiscal solvency.

Thus, players with relatively strong in-game performance will find more participation opportunities available to them, reflecting —elegantly— how corporations with sound reputation and effective marketing gain market credibility, increasing the immediate liquidity available through the Interstellar Stock Exchange.

### In-Game Currency

While the economic simulation spans diverse currencies, exchange rates, and asymmetric structures, MCr remains the universal reference.

All financial transactions conducted by a corporation within the game are translated to a 1:1,000,000 MCr scale —i.e., 0.000001 MCr equals 1 Imperial Credit (or the _stable_ currency defined by the relevant _Allegiance_).

Players may convert their in-game currencies to MCr and request withdrawals, initiating a regulated and persistent outflow aligned with the simulation and narrative gameplay.

These withdrawals are only available to corporations that meet conditions of _net profit_, _financial solvency_, and are free from _leverage or collateral obligations_.

Lastly, MCr can also be used as a **direct exchange currency within the&#x20;**_**Marketplace**_, creating a direct return flow of MCr into the system.

## Distribution

MCr is a simulated macroeconomic exchange and investment instrument, defined and issued by the Interstellar Stock Exchange.

Internally, it is designed as an algorithmically stabilized SPL token that is minted and burned according to the system's epistemic balance.

Standard SPL token distribution schemes like _preminting_ or _reward pools_ do not apply here: such arbitrary distributions are not only meaningless —they contradict the core principles of a system based on algorithmic stabilization.

### Balancing Strategies

MCr is programmatically created and destroyed through high-level balancing strategies selected by the AI, as part of its competitive-collaborative gameplay behavior.

These strategies aim for equivalent distribution and absorption of MCr from the system: not all will succeed, but results are quantifiable and observable, allowing the system to optimize its strategies in the next cycle.

The ultimate goal is to keep the MCr's purchasing power stable within the game, behaving as an _intergalactic stablecoin_ in the simulation —regardless of demand, availability, or speculative market price outside the game.

### Participation Strategies

Direct community participation —via voluntary contributions to the economy (SOL conversion or rewarded gameplay activity)— is treated as one of several strategies available to the overall stabilization system.

Planned systemic events, such as expansion phases, simulated crises, or structured campaigns, help maintain persistent MCr inflow and outflow, reflecting long-term achievements, narrative influence, or strategic contributions.

The system does not allow indiscriminate participation —it maintains a balance of Community Participation.

### Controlled Issuance

MCr issuance is neither open nor decentralized: it is managed exclusively by the Treasury system and its associated programs, applying a real-time algorithmic stabilization model based on:

* Structural health of the system: $$\text{health} = \frac{1}{1 + |\text{SUM}|}$$
* Operational capacity of _Allegiances_.
* Total circulation volume and aggregate demand.

Issuance is quantified at each simulated economic cycle, and any surplus is automatically absorbed by the Stabilization Algorithm through retention, fusion, or reconversion mechanisms.
