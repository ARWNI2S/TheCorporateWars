# Other Currencies

In addition to the system’s structural tokens, **The Corporate Wars** envisions the existence of other currencies across various levels of the simulated universe.

The _Imperial Credit_, for example, is the official currency of the **Third Imperium**, and is originally defined in terms of the **MCr** —a financial instrument of the Interstellar Stock Exchange— backing interstellar economic transactions.

### Financial Multipolarity

The **MCr** is a real SPL token deployed on the Solana network, and although it functions as a **common store of value** and technical reference for contracts between _Allegiances_, it is **not mandatory**.

No _Allegiance_ is forced to use it, and many maintain or issue their own currency through independent monetary _policies_, which must be backed by **MCr** for any transaction involving the _Interstellar Stock Exchange_.

### Local Currency

In many worlds —especially those with low technological levels (TL<6) or in economic decline— **alternative currencies emerge**: from physical local credits to regional tokens backed by resources, mining, cults, or colonial debt.

These currencies may:

- Be partially converted to MCr with variable exchange rates and fees.
- Be subject to restrictions, currency controls, or _black markets_.
- Be accepted or rejected dynamically by other _Polities_, depending on context, reputation, or strategic alignment.

> The financial ecosystem of _The Corporate Wars_ does not enforce a single standard.\
> **Each _Allegiance_ defines its own monetary _Policy_ based on its resources, economic doctrine, and position within the galactic theater.**

The currencies issued by financial _Institutions_ of the _Allegiances_ are managed exclusively within the game.

To function within the economic-financial system of the game, they must be backed by MCr in _stake_ within the ISE. However, they are **not** represented as SPL tokens —they are part of the narrative system and internal simulation economy, with no direct interface to the Solana network.

The mechanisms for converting between local currencies and MCr are regulated by the ISE and the financial _Institutions_ of the _Allegiances_, based on factors such as available liquidity, local solvency index, and the _allegiance_ and _compliance_ of the issuing entity.

***

Nevertheless, the system may allow certain _Allegiances_ or _Institutions_ —whether current in-game entities or future structures— to issue their own SPL tokens, with specific uses and rules defined by their own programs.

These parallel currencies can serve to express independent economic policies, outside the ISE, represent regional trust networks, or create specific incentives within particular zones or factions.

The viability of these additional currencies depends directly on the scope of the project and the community’s active participation.

Their appearance is neither mandatory nor automatic — it requires technical support, economic design, and active management from the development team, with Treasury backing.

If implemented, these currencies will be subject to the same technical guarantees as all other SPL assets in the system: controlled interoperability, contract-regulated usage, and coherence with the general economic model of the universe.
