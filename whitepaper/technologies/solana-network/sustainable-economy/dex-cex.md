# External Markets

Although **The Corporate Wars** relies on blockchain technology and SPL tokens, the purpose of the project is **not** to list the MCr —nor any other in-game currency— on decentralized exchanges (DEX) or centralized exchanges (CEX).

The economic system is designed to operate internally, without depending on external liquidity or speculative flows.

The priority is to build a complete playable environment, with technical depth, consistent mechanics, and quality content.

That said, if community participation allows and the project reaches a sufficient scale, the possibility of enabling secondary markets will be evaluated.

Not for ideological reasons, but for practical ones: it wouldn’t make sense to leave large reserve volumes inactive if they can be used to grant access to useful financial tools for players.

However, the costs associated with such operations are significant.

Establishing a real liquidity pool requires minimum amounts in the range of 50,000, 100,000, or even 200,000 USD in locked assets.

This makes no sense in an early stage, where those same resources could be directed toward system development, content production, technical improvements, or feature expansion.

The technical cost of minting 1 MCr or 1,000,000 MCr is practically the same — but real liquidity requires backing, volume, and responsibility.

It is not justifiable to divert critical funds into an external pool if that compromises the game’s development pace.

The option remains on the table, but its execution will depend entirely on the level of participation, support, and sustainability reached by the project.

The more contributions, the greater the ability to balance gameplay and liquidity.

But at this stage, the priority is clear: build the system first.

Everything else comes later.
