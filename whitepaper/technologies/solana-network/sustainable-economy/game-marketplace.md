# Game Marketplace

> The economic system of **The Corporate Wars** includes an integrated marketplace where players can acquire goods, services, structures, licenses, and upgrades that complement their operations within the simulated universe.

We redefine the concept of a _game marketplace_ by integrating it with the causality, persistence, and scale of the game universe —transforming _upgrades_, _chests_, _diamonds_, and _skins_ into elements embedded within the lore and available game mechanics: _subsidies_, _institutional interest_, _parallel investments_, _family inheritances_, _buybacks_, _capital absorption_, _liquidations..._ and a long list of _realistic logical possibilities_ inside a universe of scale.

> To me, current monetization mechanisms feel like "_paying for air_": the skin implementation already exists in patch x.y.z, consumables offer no real advantage or last very little, and the truly useful items "_drop_" from paid gacha with "_0.infinity%_" odds —in other words... never.\
> —_ManOguaR, Lead Developer_

Players are not paying for _four bytes in a database_: _10 potions, 5 scrolls, and 500 diamonds_ � they are acquiring a fragment integrated into the participatory gameplay experience.

The catalog is extensive, intended to offer possibilities comparable to any complex game.

However, everything that can be acquired is tied to the general economic system: no element is external or isolated.

> Every acquisition has a place, a cost, and an effect within the game�s balance.

## Market Strategies

Resource inflow into the system occurs through gameplay-integrated means and is justified within the universe: concessions, institutional agreements, covert investment, strategic backing, or participation in pre-existing structures.

The market does not function as a source of arbitrary advantages, but as another layer of economic interaction.

Once integrated into the system, this economic interaction allows game AI subsystems to adjust their Community Participation strategies to cover the system Treasury�s operational needs.

The available offers will be affected both by the system�s financial state and by the actual simulation state and in-game progression of each player.

Opportunities are there, but their impact depends on context, timing, and how they are managed in-game.

### Defensive Balance

Some players �or groups� adopt aggressive marketplace strategies: hoarding limited availability offers, mass-purchasing _chests_ or _bundles_, flooding the market with items, and destabilizing auctions or other community mechanisms.

Disparities in the players' _real purchasing power_ often disrupt the game�s systemic balance.

> Games with formidable mechanics, like _BattleForge_ �a powerful mix of CCG and RTS, developed by EA� _went to hell_ due to strategic failures in the marketplace: lack of regulation created a brutal _paywall_, _bots_ and _scalpers_ employed _digital scalping_ strategies, and a _new user exodus_ weakened the ecosystem.\
> The developers tried to switch to a _free-to-play_ model to boost player participation.\
> **Result:** the original design was never meant to support that; revenues dropped and the internal economy lost all perceived value � shut down the servers.\
> �_ManOguaR, Lead Developer_

Players may aspire to embody great _Allegiances_, but their scale is so vast that it would be impossible for a single player to efficiently manage all assets in line with the simulation's level of detail.

Reaching operational levels comparable to major galactic entities isn�t impossible � but it requires global vision, long-term coordination among players, and persistence across multiple fronts.

What matters isn�t how much is acquired, but how it integrates into an ecosystem that reacts, adjusts, and evolves with every move.
