# AI LOD

In large-scale virtual worlds —especially those that simulate open, persistent environments populated by numerous autonomous agents— one of the main technical challenges is maintaining acceptable performance without compromising the coherence or realism of simulated behavior.

{% hint style="success" %}
To address this issue, a technique known as **AI LOD** (Level of Detail applied to artificial intelligence) is employed.
{% endhint %}

## AI LOD

Inspired by traditional level-of-detail mechanisms used in graphics, this technique consists of adapting the complexity of agent behavior simulation based on contextual relevance.

> In other words, not all characters or entities in a simulated world need to run their AI logic at full resolution or fidelity at all times.

A character that is not visible to the player, or located far from any relevant area, can operate using a simplified or decelerated version of its internal logic without negatively affecting the gameplay experience or the integrity of the simulated world.

{% hint style="info" %}
**AI LOD** therefore enables efficient use of computational resources by concentrating processing power in areas of the world that truly require it, while reducing the simulation cost in peripheral or inactive regions.
{% endhint %}

### AI LOD in Distributed Simulation

When the simulation engine operates in a distributed environment�that is, when multiple nodes execute different parts of the simulated world in parallel�the application of AI LOD becomes even more strategic.

In such a context, each node may contain simulation regions with varying degrees of activity, relevance, or proximity to players or other observers.

Dynamically applying AI LOD allows each node to modulate the resolution of its internal logic based on local and global criteria: from the density of active entities to network traffic or computational load.

Furthermore, the multiscale synchronization system inherent to distributed simulation makes it possible for different AI levels to operate on different temporal schedules, maintaining overall coherence without requiring uniform update rates across all nodes.

In extreme cases, entities may even completely suspend their internal logic, preserving only their essential state and waiting to be reactivated when the system deems it necessary.

This intelligent suspension is especially useful in long-running simulations, where thousands or millions of entities may coexist without needing to be actively simulated in every cycle.

Finally, AI LOD also enhances dynamic load-balancing mechanisms: by temporarily reducing simulation load in less relevant areas, resources can be freed up on congested nodes or entities can be redistributed without any perceptible loss of realism.

## Conclusion

AI LOD is an essential technique for scaling complex systems that simulate autonomous behaviors in real time.

Its integration into distributed architectures not only improves overall performance, but also enables much smarter management of available resources.

In scenarios such as persistent economic simulations, inhabited virtual worlds, or large-scale autonomous ecosystems, the strategic use of AI LOD becomes a critical technical foundation.
