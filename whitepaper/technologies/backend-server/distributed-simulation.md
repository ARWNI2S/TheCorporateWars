# Distributed Simulation

In complex environments such as virtual economies, persistent ecosystems, or large-scale multiplayer games, the ability to simulate multiple systems in parallel becomes essential.

Distributed simulation addresses this challenge through an architecture in which multiple computing units—nodes—cooperate to execute a shared simulation that is synchronized yet decentralized.

***

Unlike traditional models, where a single central server processes the entire (or a fixed portion of the) world state, a distributed system distributes the workload across multiple nodes, each responsible for executing a segment of the simulation.

These nodes act as universal executors: they can process any type of task, from physics simulation to artificial intelligence, economic logic, or network synchronization.

Each task in the system is represented as a structured unit, with explicit dependencies between them.

This allows execution to be organized into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), defining the natural order of processing without manual intervention.

However, despite this independence, nodes must coordinate to maintain a coherent view of the simulated world.

This coordination is achieved through a multiscale synchronization system: although each node may operate at a different frequency—processing multiple internal steps before synchronizing with others—all respect a shared framework that defines the key alignment points between them.

At these synchronization points, nodes exchange information, resolve inter-node dependencies, and ensure global state coherence.

***

One of the strongest features of this approach is its adaptability.

The system can detect runtime load imbalances or stalls.

When this occurs, it automatically redistributes pending tasks and, if necessary, migrates the entities that originated them to lighter nodes.

This dynamic load balancing mechanism ensures smooth execution even under localized activity spikes or irregular workloads.

***

During each global simulation cycle, nodes run their own internal cycles, enabling different systems to operate at different temporal resolutions within the same coherent universe.

This makes it possible, for example, for a low-frequency strategic system to coexist with a high-resolution physics simulation—without interference or unnecessary latency.

This distributed model allows the simulation to scale as virtual worlds, interactions, or the number of participating agents grow.

It also enables greater resilience, since the failure of a single node does not necessarily interrupt the system, but instead triggers a temporary reconfiguration of the execution topology.

***

In summary, distributed simulation offers a robust, scalable, and adaptable solution for the complex systems of the future.

By clearly separating tasks, their dependencies, and their distributed execution, it enables the modeling of rich and dynamic worlds with a level of efficiency unthinkable in monolithic architectures.
