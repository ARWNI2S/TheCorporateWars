# The Next Milieu

It is Imperial Year 1201 in the Third Imperium.

We are in Solar Year 5637.

Ushar kimegi Imkarsham 5721, iishan Ziru Sirka.

Zhdantl drintiar 6321 tlotl.

Htyao Ftao 3601 Tlaukhu'we'rr.

It is the honorable 20123 Federation Year.

Vagh'rra! Rroezhakha **100'k'rrr** nurghrra'rrr.

> There was no rebellion, no event triggered the fall of the Imperium. There never was any "virus", and the only "new era" I know... is today!

## Milieu 1.2

**The Corporate Wars** takes us 80 years into the future, picking up the classic Traveller™ timeline, leaning on the "extended Golden Age" from GURPS.

In this future: the Third Imperium remains stable, opening relations with the Zhodani Consulate and at peace with the Solomani; paving the way for economic stability predictions unprecedented in the history of the Galaxy.

Ancestral fortunes of the Vilani Nobility compete in the stock market with the Federation, while Aslan matriarchs hunt down every opportunity within the clan�s reach.

The Vargr Extents are even more extensive, literally merging with the Imperium and the Two Thousand Worlds, in a delicate balance of power, influence, and leadership.

It is the year 1201: a "new era" :P of opportunity, expansion, and understanding of the galaxy.
