## _Milieu 1.2?_

**The Corporate Wars** takes us 80 years into the future, picking up the classic Traveller™ timeline, leaning on the "extended Golden Age" from GURPS.

In this future: the Third Imperium remains stable, opening relations with the Zhodani Consulate and at peace with the Solomani; paving the way for economic stability predictions unprecedented in the history of the Galaxy.

Ancestral fortunes of the Vilani Nobility compete in the stock market with the Federation, while Aslan matriarchs hunt down every opportunity within the clans' reach.

The Vargr Extents are even more extensive, literally merging with the Imperium and the Two Thousand Worlds, in a delicate balance of power, influence, and leadership.
