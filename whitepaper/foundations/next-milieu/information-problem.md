# The Information Problem

Radio waves cannot exceed the speed of light, and messages can take years to reach even the nearest star.

This makes ships equipped with **jump drives** the only reliable means of information flow, reducing communication latency to the duration of transport journeys.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This limitation is integrated into the gameplay experience:

1. Information is not available in real time; decisions are made with partial, outdated data and require anticipation.
2. Nothing happens instantly; interstellar distances are vast, and round trips for information and goods consume time and resources.\
   Managing reliable communication routes is key to strategic success.
{% endhint %}

> The logistics of interstellar mail —and the reliability of jump routes— are structural challenges common to all high-tech civilizations and have triggered some of the greatest crises in galactic history.

{% hint style="success" %}
Players must adjust their strategies to overcome ruthless logistical constraints and navigate regulations imposed by interplanetary powers seeking to maintain their grip over trade and data routes.
