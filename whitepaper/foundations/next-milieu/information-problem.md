# The Information Problem

Radio waves cannot exceed the speed of light, and messages can take years to reach even the nearest star.

This makes ships equipped with **jump drives** the only reliable means of information flow, reducing communication latency to the duration of transport journeys.

{% hint style="success" %}
This limitation is integrated into the gameplay experience:  
- Information is not available in real time; decisions are made with partial, outdated data and require anticipation.  
- Nothing happens instantly; interstellar distances are vast, and round trips for information and goods consume time and resources.  
Managing reliable communication routes is key to strategic success.
{% endhint %}

> The logistics of interstellar mail —and the reliability of jump routes— are structural challenges common to all high-tech civilizations and have triggered some of the greatest crises in galactic history.

Players must adjust their strategies to overcome ruthless logistical constraints and navigate regulations imposed by interplanetary powers seeking to maintain their grip over trade and data routes.
