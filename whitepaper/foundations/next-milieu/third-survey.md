# Third Survey

The history of the Third Imperium is marked by stages of expansion and periods of stability.

The **First Survey** was the first great imperial exploratory effort, where the inhabited worlds were cataloged, the jump corridors were mapped, and the first borders were drawn.

The **Second Survey** has been a systematic update, which has redefined the main routes and formalized the trade and mail lines.

And now, in the present, the **Third Survey** has begun:

A monumental initiative of the Imperial Interstellar Exploration Service in collaboration with the private sector, the **Hakyeahtaorl**, the **Driantia Dazhia**, the **Two Thousand Worlds**, and even **SolSec**, to chart not only Charted Space, but also the marginal worlds, the forgotten frontiers, and the enclaves left behind in the Long Night.

## The Importance of the Third Survey

In **The Corporate Wars**, the Third Survey represents not only a thematic background setting, but the philosophy on which the map of the Galaxy is built.

> The Third Survey is a structural database of stellar systems and jump routes, with periodically updated data, stored on blockchain, which allows auditing and distributed real-time access.
>
> The Third Survey is the fundamental structure on which the rest of the game systems are built.

Players participate, through exploration, in the growth of the game's limits, update data from isolated worlds, and transport information across great distances.
