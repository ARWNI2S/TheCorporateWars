# Third Survey

The history of the Third Imperium is marked by stages of expansion and periods of stability.

The **First Survey** was the first great imperial exploratory effort, where the inhabited worlds were cataloged, the jump corridors were mapped, and the first borders were drawn.

The **Second Survey** has been a systematic update, which has redefined the main routes and formalized the trade and mail lines.

And now, in the present, the **Third Survey** has begun:

A monumental initiative of the Imperial Interstellar Exploration Service in collaboration with the private sector, the **Hakyeahtaorl**, the **Driantia Dazhia**, the **Two Thousand Worlds**, and even **SolSec**, to chart not only known space, but also the marginal worlds, the forgotten frontiers, and the enclaves left behind in the Long Night.

## Interstellar Exploration Service

Once a cradle of adventurers, today the Exploration Service is an administrative and bureaucratic institution.

After fully completing the Second Survey, it dedicated itself to strengthening and modernizing the Imperial Mail routes, delegating much of its field activity to the private sector.

### Imperial Edict 1143.1

In the year 1143, the First Imperial Edict was the approval and entry into force of private explorer licenses, issued by the Exploration Service under the Authority of the Emperor.

This policy formalized the Interstellar Exploration Service as an Imperial authority, increasing the reach and prestige of the institution.

As a consequence, it is the private sector, specialized freelancers, and corporations who carry out the reconnaissance and first contact missions in remote systems.

This has led the Exploration Service to establish a precedent of **astrographic business** beyond the borders of the empire, from deep space merchants to Zhodani corporations, Aslan clans, and Vargr, all have appreciated the **value** of trading with updated data of the galaxy.

## The Importance of the Third Survey

In **The Corporate Wars**, the Third Survey represents not only a thematic background setting, but the philosophy on which the map of the Galaxy is built.

> The Third Survey is a structural database of stellar systems and jump routes, with periodically updated data, stored on blockchain, which allows auditing and distributed real-time access.

Players obtain a partial view of the galaxy's data, always depending on two things: the databases available locally � devices, ship computers, star maps; and the global updates � planetary computers, X-Comm beacons, or X-Boat routes, among others.

The game server maintains a set of valid data adjusted to the player's point of view for each game session, taking as a source of truth the updates stored on the blockchain.

> The Third Survey is the fundamental structure on which the rest of the game systems are built.

Players participate, through exploration, in the growth of the game's limits, update data from isolated worlds, and transport information across great distances.
