# Expansion Business

The importance of the different worlds determines how they connect to each other, drawing the routes of interstellar transit.

Consolidated interstellar mail routes establish infrastructures maintained by local populations, whose natural growth leads to an impact on the trade routes.

## The Galactic Market

Corporations are present throughout the entire circuit of galactic expansion:

1. the exploitation of resources requires a workforce,
2. population and machinery provide that workforce.
3. The machinery must be acquired or manufactured,
4. the population must be available or colonized.
5. This implies building and maintaining facilities, habitats, and leisure centers,
6. which in turn require sources of energy...
7. logistics of export, import, and transportation of goods,
8. and a constant flow of emigrants and new colonists...

In each of the steps, for each of the processes, corporations are involved in one way or another.
