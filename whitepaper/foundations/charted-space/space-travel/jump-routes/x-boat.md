# Information Lanes

Information lanes are specialized routes dedicated to the secure and rapid transmission of data between star systems.

Unlike trade or passenger routes, their priority is not cargo, but the uninterrupted flow of critical information: diplomatic communications, strategic intelligence, intersystem contracts, financial reports, or scientific data.

These lanes are typically serviced by fast, lightweight vessels —such as classic jump couriers— capable of covering several parsecs with autonomy and high reliability. Examples include legacy networks like the IISS X-boat system or private corporate mail grids.

Some lanes are public and regulated, while others are covert, redundant, or restricted to specific entities. Their presence is essential to maintaining operational coordination, commercial trust, and cultural cohesion across the interstellar community.

> When FTL transmissions are impossible, information lanes become the true backbone of interstellar civilization.
