# Trade Routes

Trade routes are economic corridors shaped by supply chains, market demand, political agreements, and long-term commercial viability.

Unlike jump routes, which are determined by stellar geography and navigation constraints, trade routes reflect the flow of goods, services, and capital across the interstellar community.

While most trade routes rely on existing jump corridors, not all jump routes are economically active.

Some trade routes bypass technically possible paths in favor of those that offer safer conditions, better infrastructure, or more favorable trade terms.

Trade routes are dynamic â€”they shift with political influence, technological developments, and economic pressure.

Major corporations, regional alliances, and local actors constantly renegotiate their control and usage, turning trade into both a logistical network and a strategic battlefield.
