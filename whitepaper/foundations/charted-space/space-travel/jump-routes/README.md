# Jump Routes

Jump routes define the structured pathways for interstellar travel, shaped by stellar geography, jump limitations, and navigational reliability across the interstellar community.

## Main Routes

Main routes are stable, high-volume jump corridors connecting major worlds and system hubs.

Maintained through collective interest, they form the backbone of mobility, trade, and information flow within the interstellar community.

## Feeder Routes

Feeder routes branch off from the main arteries to connect smaller colonies, outposts, and marginal systems.

Though sometimes underfunded or irregular, they are essential for maintaining integration and resilience across the wider network.
