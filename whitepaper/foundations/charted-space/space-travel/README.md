# Space Travel

Space travel is the backbone of the Interstellar Community in **The Corporate Wars**.

The ability to move people, goods, and data across the vast expanses of space is what keeps the economy running, enables territorial expansion, and defines relationships between worlds and civilizations.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Since faster-than-light communication does not exist, starships are the only means of transmitting information and coordinating large-scale operations.
{% endhint %}

***

Space routes are determined by the accessibility of star systems and the presence of infrastructure such as spaceports and refueling stations.

Some regions feature well-established corridors with frequent and secure traffic, while others are high-risk zones due to pirate activity, interstellar conflicts, or hazardous space conditions.

> For corporations, mastering space travel means not only optimizing logistics but also securing control over strategic routes.

{% hint style="success" %}
Accessing the best trade corridors, ensuring the protection of their convoys, and establishing transportation monopolies can be the difference between a profitable operation and one doomed to failure.
{% endhint %}
