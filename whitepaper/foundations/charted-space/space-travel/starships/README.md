# Starships and Spacecraft

Interstellar transportation in **The Corporate Wars** relies on a combination of advanced propulsion technology and starship designs optimized for specific roles.

From massive freighters to light exploration vessels, each type of ship plays a vital role in galactic mobility and interstellar economy.

The difference between starships and spacecraft is determined not by their size or technological level, but by their ability to jump between the stars.

### Spacecraft

These are vehicles designed for local or intrastellar operations.

They operate within a single star system, using conventional or gravitic propulsion, without the need for jump drives.

{% hint style="success" %}
They are ideal for mining, orbital transport, local patrols, and logistics between stations or moons.

### Starships

These are spacefaring vessels equipped with jump drives, enabling them to perform interstellar transits.

They are the backbone of interstellar trade, imperial expansion, and the connectivity between worlds.

> Every starship is, by definition, also a spacecraft â€”but not every spacecraft is capable of crossing the gulf between stars.
