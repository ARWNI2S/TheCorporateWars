# Starships and Spacecraft

Interstellar transportation in **The Corporate Wars** relies on a combination of advanced propulsion technology and starship designs optimized for specific roles.

From massive freighters to light exploration vessels, each type of ship plays a vital role in galactic mobility and the inter-system economy.

The difference between starships and spacecraft is determined not by their size or technological level, but by their ability to jump between the stars.

## Power Plants and Drives

Drives and power plants are the heart of any ship, determining its speed, range, and operational efficiency.

Maneuver drives enable navigation within a star system, the interstellar **jump drive** is the only way to travel between stars within manageable timeframes.

Efficient power plants enbale these drives to operate within a reasonable consumption of refined fuel.

Access to different levels of propulsion technology defines a fleet’s competitiveness and its ability to operate in trade, warfare, or exploration.

Corporations that dominate the manufacturing, maintenance, and supply of drives and power systems not only control the flow of goods and people across the galaxy but also influence interstellar geopolitics — establishing transportation networks that can either consolidate or destabilize entire regions.
