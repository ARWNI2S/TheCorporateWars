# Naval Architecture System

The design of starships in **The Corporate Wars** follows rational and strategic principles.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The _Naval Architecture System_ enables the development of vessels that are coherent with their operational roles, optimizing resources and capabilities according to their function and specific needs.
{% endhint %}

## Mission

The mission of a spacecraft is the key factor that determines its design, configuration, and equipment.

Each vessel fulfills a clear role: patrol, transport, trade, exploration, research, diplomacy, or warfare.

Based on this primary mission, systems are selected accordingly: cargo hold size, sensor suites, weaponry, life support systems, jump range, sublight propulsion type, and level of automation.

> As example, a rapid-response medical ship prioritizes speed and modularity to host mobile surgical units and quarantine zones.\
> A light patrol corvette will feature long-range sensors, modular weapon mounts, and space for inspection teams.

Design decisions are not arbitrary, but the logical consequence of the vessel's intended operational purpose within its functional deployment environment.
