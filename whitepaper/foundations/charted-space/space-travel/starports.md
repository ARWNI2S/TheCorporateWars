# Starports

**Starports** are more than simple landing facilities, they are nerve centers where ships refuel, contracts are negotiated, and civilizations interact.

From high-tech orbital stations to rudimentary outposts on the surfaces of remote worlds, each starport plays a role in the vast network of interstellar trade and transportation.

Some are luxurious enclaves with facilities catering to the galaxy’s elite, while others are dangerous transit points where pirates and dubious traders mingle in search of opportunities.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The quality and capacity of a starport determine its importance within the galactic economy.
{% endhint %}

***

> For corporations, controlling or influencing a starport means dominating the flow of goods and passengers, imposing tariffs, ensuring operational security, and restricting competitors’ access.

{% hint style="success" %}
_Polities_ with the resources to develop or manage these logistical nodes can consolidate their power and monopolize key sectors of galactic trade.
