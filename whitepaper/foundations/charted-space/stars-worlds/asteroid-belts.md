# Asteroid Belts

Asteroid belts are regions within a star system filled with rocky and metallic fragments â€” remnants of planetary formation.

Though inhospitable to life, these debris fields are vital to the interstellar economy, as they contain high concentrations of minerals essential for manufacturing and the construction of space infrastructure.

Corporations exploit these belts through mining stations and automated extraction fleets that process asteroids in search of valuable materials such as heavy metals, rare earth elements, and compounds used in advanced technologies.

Beyond their industrial value, asteroid belts also serve as strategic points for hidden bases, pirate havens, or covert military installations.

Their fragmented composition and countless moving objects make detection and access difficult, turning them into ideal territories for operations beyond the oversight of major powers.

Control over a key asteroid belt can grant a corporation a significant advantage in the trade of critical materials, ensuring a steady supply for industrial expansion and starship production.

In a universe where resources define power, these regions represent both a source of immense wealth and a potential battleground for control over their vast resources.
