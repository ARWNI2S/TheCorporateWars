# Stars and Worlds

The **Charted Space** is made up of countless planetary systems, each with its own combination of stars, planets, moons, and minor bodies.

***

Stars define the nature of a system: from long-lived red dwarfs to short-lived blue giants, each stellar type influences habitability and available resources.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Systems with multiple suns may pose additional challenges for navigation and colonization due to their complex orbits.
{% endhint %}

***

Habitable worlds are rare and valuable: while many planets can host colonies through terraforming or artificial habitats, finding a world with naturally favorable conditions is a strategic asset.

However, habitability isn’t everything — arid, frozen, or gaseous worlds can serve as crucial sources of industrial and energy resources.

> Understanding the distribution and characteristics of planetary systems is essential for any corporation seeking expansion.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Controlling a system rich in resources or with access to vital trade routes can mean economic dominance in a sector, while choosing a poorly located world could doom an operation to failure.
{% endhint %}
