# Stars and Worlds

The universe of **The Corporate Wars** is made up of countless planetary systems, each with its own combination of stars, planets, moons, and minor bodies.

Stars define the nature of a system: from long-lived red dwarfs to short-lived blue giants, each stellar type influences habitability and available resources.

Systems with multiple suns may pose additional challenges for navigation and colonization due to their complex orbits.

Habitable worlds are rare and valuable: while many planets can host colonies through terraforming or artificial habitats, finding a world with naturally favorable conditions is a strategic asset.

However, habitability isn’t everything — arid, frozen, or gaseous worlds can serve as crucial sources of industrial and energy resources.

Understanding the distribution and characteristics of planetary systems is essential for any corporation seeking expansion.

Controlling a system rich in resources or with access to vital trade routes can mean economic dominance in a sector, while choosing a poorly located world could doom an operation to failure.
