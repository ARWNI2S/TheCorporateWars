# Gas Giants

Gas giants are massive planetary bodies composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with no defined solid surface.

Although inhospitable to traditional colonization, these worlds are essential to interstellar infrastructure due to the richness of their atmospheres in exploitable elements.

> Operations around gas giants typically focus on fuel extraction â€” such as refined hydrogen for fusion reactors and other exotic gases used in various industrial and technological applications.

***

Some gas giants have [moons](planets-moons/) rich in minerals or suitable for colonization, turning them into centers of economic activity within a star system.

Additionally, certain gravitational or atmospheric anomalies can make these planets strategic points for trade, fleet transit, or even the development of hidden installations far from the oversight of interstellar powers.

Access to and control over a key gas giant can mean the difference between a stable supply network and costly dependence on external providers.
