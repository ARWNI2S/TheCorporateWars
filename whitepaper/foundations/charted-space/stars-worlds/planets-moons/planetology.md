# World Survey

World survey is part of the effort by _Polities_ and _Allegiances_ to record, update, and publish information about worlds within Charted Space.

This audit not only gathers technical data but also aims to understand how planetary societies, their resources, challenges, and opportunities have evolved since previous surveys.

> For megacorporations, nobles, explorers, and imperial agents, this data is essential: it defines where to invest, which routes to secure, what alliances to negotiate… and which conflicts to avoid or provoke.

### Universal World Profile

The UWP (Universal World Profile) is a compact system for describing worlds in the Traveller universe and derivatives like The Corporate Wars.

It uses an alphanumeric string —like A867A9B— where each digit or letter summarizes a key characteristic of the world.
