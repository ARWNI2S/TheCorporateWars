# Hostile Environments

Most worlds within Charted Space are inhospitable: extreme temperatures and pressures, frozen wastelands, toxic or corrosive atmospheres.

> Rains of molten metal or glass, supersonic winds, lava seas, lethal radiation, frozen oceans, and even more exotic phenomena.

For Humaniti, they are deadly; for corporations, they are sources of noble gases, rare metals, or exotic compounds impossible to synthesize.

### Extrosophonts

In some of these extreme environments, life evolves, surprisingly pushing the boundaries of biology; sometimes even reaching the level of sophonts: sentient species known for technologies as extreme as their worlds of origin.

Studying them may reveal cultural processes and biological adaptations that inspire new technologies; yet the —likewise extreme— differences with Humaniti often spark conflicts of conquest and exploitation.
