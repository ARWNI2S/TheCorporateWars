# Planets and Moons

From fertile, habitable planets to toxic deserts and frozen moons, each celestial body presents its own set of opportunities and challenges for expansion, resource exploitation, and colony establishment.

> Despite their differences, all worlds hold strategic value determined by their location, accessibility, and resource wealth.

***

Moons, though smaller in size, can be just as crucial as planets: their low gravity and proximity to other celestial bodies make them key points for industry, trade, and defense.

> Many corporations establish mining complexes, transit stations, and operational bases on moons, using their position to control trade routes or extract hard-to-reach materials.

Controlling a well-positioned world can mean dominance over an entire region â€” as an industrial hub, logistical node, or military stronghold.
