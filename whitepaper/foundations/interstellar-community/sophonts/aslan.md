# Aslan

The **Aslan** are one of the major powers of the galaxy, known for their hierarchical and deeply territorial social structure.

Originating from the planet _Kuzu_, the Aslan form the **Tlaukhu** �_Aslan Hierate_, a network of clans ruled by **Ahriy'i** �_matriarchs_, where honor, territorial expansion, and lineage are fundamental pillars.

> Pride, tradition, and a hunger for new worlds characterize the Aslan, who see expansion as both a natural right and an ancestral duty.

***

Aslan society draws a clear distinction between genders: males are warriors, explorers, and 'politicians', while females manage the economy, technology, and administration.

This duality has allowed the _Hierate_ to expand aggressively while maintaining an efficient internal structure.

To the Imperium and other powers, the Aslan are both rivals and occasional allies, guided by codes of honor that define all their interactions.
