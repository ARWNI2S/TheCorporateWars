# Other Sophonts

Every world that remains habitable long enough holds a certain chance of evolving intelligent life, capable of organizing into complex societies.

The biological evolution of sophonts shapes cultures and technologies unique to their environment.

Some barely reach preindustrial levels, while others achieve remarkable advances in specific domains.

In many cases, they remain ignored or exploited by more advanced civilizations, or are directly absorbed by corporations or imperial powers.

In certain corners of the galaxy, only ruins remain — silent witnesses to extinct sophont species whose origins intertwine with myths about the Precursors.

> The diversity of sophonts is one of the great hidden engines of galactic history, though to many they are little more than names in a report or merchandise in a contract.
