# Sophont Generation System

The exploration of worlds is accompanied by first contacts, unexpected encounters, and the discovery of species previously unknown.

The game universe features a dedicated system for the creation of sophonts: intelligent species generated with cultural, technological, and social parameters tailored to the game setting.

***

As the map of the galaxy expands, each newly explored corner brings with it unique cultures, unpredictable challenges, and unforeseen opportunities, enriching both the game content and player experience.

{% hint style="success" %}
Thanks to this approach, each created sophont is integrated organically into the galactic ecosystem, ensuring that its culture, economy, and relationships are believable and playable within the universe of **The Corporate Wars**.
