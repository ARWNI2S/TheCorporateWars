# K'kree

The **K'kree** are one of the major species of the galaxy, recognizable by their centauroid form, strongly gregarious society, and extreme vegan ideology.

Originating from the planet _Kirur_, the K'kree have built a vast interstellar empire known as the **Two Thousand Worlds**, driven by an expansive ideology centered on herbivore purity.

> They hold a profound abhorrence for carnivores and have waged extermination campaigns against species and cultures they deem predatory.

***

Their culture values group unity, tradition, and strict social control.

K'kree life is marked by mutual surveillance, rejection of individualism, and reverence for their ancestors.

To other civilizations, the K'kree are both a military threat and a cultural enigma, known for their massive fleets, monumental architecture, and obsession with purging what they see as “carnivore contamination” from space.

Herbivore pride, ideological fanaticism, and collective might define the K'kree, who see their mission as a universal duty.
