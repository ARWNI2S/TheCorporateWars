# Vargr

The **Vargr** are the sophonts native to the _Vargr Extents_, located _spinward_ of the Imperium, known for their canine appearance and intensely dynamic social nature.

Genetically, the Vargr share most of their genome with Humaniti and are partially biologically compatible: they are susceptible to similar viruses, bacteria, and antibiotics.

> They are considered another example of _convergent evolution_, reinforcing the general theory of life's development across the galaxy.

***

Vargr society is characterized by its lack of rigid hierarchical structures: leadership is earned through success and prestige, not lineage or formal right.

This fluidity gives rise to alliances, fleets, corsair bands, and even planetary governments that can emerge and dissolve within mere years.

To Humaniti and other species, the Vargr appear unpredictable, intense, and often chaotic, yet also vibrant, ingenious, and fiercely loyal to their close circles.

Trade, exploration, and piracy intertwine in Vargr history, making them both competitors and allies, ensuring their presence is felt at every galactic frontier.
