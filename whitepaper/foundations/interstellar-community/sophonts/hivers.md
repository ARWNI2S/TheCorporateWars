# Hivers

Among the sophonts of the galaxy, the most _alien_ are the **Hivers**.

Known primarily as founding members of **The Federation**, Hivers are an enigmatic yet diplomatically accessible species, often appearing in Federal delegations, commercial crews, and mixed embassies.

Physically, Hiver individuals display radial symmetry with multiple flexible limbs, covered by a resilient chitinous exoskeleton.

Their senses are numerous and distributed, including compound eyes, sensory antennae, and specialized organs difficult to compare to those of Humaniti.

They lack a recognizable face, reinforcing the perception of their otherness.

Their deliberate movements, chemical-based communication, and apparent lack of visible emotions make them even more alien in human eyes.

Nonetheless, they stand out for their curiosity, skill in trade and diplomacy, and tireless interest in interacting with other species.

Despite their appearance, for many sophonts Hivers represent a valuable partner and a respected member of the galactic community.
