# Solomani

The **Solomani** are a branch of Humaniti originating from Sol, recognized in their own tradition as the cradle of humanity.

They forged their identity after expanding beyond their homeworld, developing a strong sense of cultural and biological supremacy over other human branches.

Although their attempt at galactic hegemony culminated in the fall of the Solomani Confederation to the Third Imperium, their influence persists, and their ideology —Solomanism— remains alive, fueling nationalist movements, separatist factions, and a deep pride in their Solar heritage.

> Competitive technology, a spacefaring tradition, and a firm belief in _manifest destiny_ define the Solomani, who consider Sol the true home of all Humaniti.
