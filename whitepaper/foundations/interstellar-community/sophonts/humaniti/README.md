# Humaniti

**Humaniti** is the collective term that encompasses all known human variants across the galaxy, including the Solomani, Vilani, Zhodani, Darrians, Suerrat, Geonee, and other lesser-known lineages.

Although there are significant genetic and cultural differences among these branches, they all share a remarkable biological and reproductive compatibility, allowing them to be classified as a single species despite their geographic dispersion and separate evolutionary paths.

The accepted theory holds that Humaniti is an example of convergent evolution, and that sociogenetic compatibility is a natural process occurring across the galaxy.

> Solomani, Zhodani, and Vilani each claim that the origin of Humaniti lies on a single world, proposing Sol, Zhdant, and Vland respectively.

***

The Third Imperium is considered a representative example: a diversity of integrated Humaniti â€”peoples from different worlds, biologically compatible, who despite cultural and genetic differences coexist under a single political structure, sharing a common identity.
