# Vilani

The **Vilani** are one of the oldest branches of Humaniti, originating from the planet Vland.

They were the founders of the Ziru Sirka (First Imperium), an interstellar civilization characterized by rigid hierarchy, conservatism, and a strong emphasis on social and economic stability.

Although their hegemony ended millennia ago, their cultural, technological, and administrative influence continues to permeate the Third Imperium, where they hold prominent positions in bureaucracy, commerce, and nobility.

> Millennia-old interstellar institutions, titanic megacorporations, and inflexible bureaucratic rituals —hallmarks of Vilani culture— safeguard the secrets of managing and administering an ancestral wealth that the Vilani guard with fierce devotion.
