# Zhodani

The **Zhodani** are one of the major branches of Humaniti, originating from the planet Zhdant, capital of the Zhodani Consulate.

Their society is characterized by the open integration of psionics at all levels —social, cultural, and technological— extending from government to daily life and the sciences.

The Zhodani value honesty, social harmony, and mental transparency, relying on a ruling psionic elite to maintain order and collective well-being.

To many outside the Consulate, the Zhodani are viewed with suspicion, seen as authoritarian, manipulative, or even unsettling due to their use of telepathy in politics and justice.

However, within their culture, the values of trust, unity, and psionic cooperation are a source of pride and cohesion.

> Advanced technology, social discipline, and a strong sense of psychic identity define the Zhodani, who consider their civilization an evolutionary example of Humaniti.
