# Sophonts

Interstellar societies are composed of intelligent species, collectively known as _sophonts_ (from the Terran Greek word **Sophia**, meaning _wisdom_).

These entities vary in their evolutionary, cultural, and technological development, generating unique policies in governance and modes of expansion across the galaxy.

The interaction between sophonts defines the balance of power in the galaxy, directly impacting the economy, politics, and security.

Some species have specific industrial and logistical needs, creating unique commercial opportunities in the supply of goods, technology, and services.

On the other hand, tensions between factions or species can escalate into economic cold wars or open conflicts, where corporations may intervene â€”whether as mediators, security providers, or even instigators of destabilization for profit.

> Understanding sophonts is not just a matter of diplomacy, but a strategic advantage for expanding operations and consolidating power in the galaxy.
