# The Interstellar Community

Multiple civilizations, _Polities_, and sophonts coexist within a community spanning hundreds of parsecs, united in a delicate balance where the limitations of communication and transportation define both opportunities and challenges.

Technologies vary between regions, technological progress is uneven across worlds, and collective advancement depends on the ability to manage transportation and communication networks.

> Those who master interstellar mobility can consolidate their power and shape the future of the galaxy.

## Cosmopolis

The great powers administer vast territories through local authorities with varying degrees of autonomy, while corporations have optimized the movement of goods and information to operate in an environment of constant communication delays.

To endure, societies have developed efficient logistical networks, relay messaging systems, and decentralized governance models that enable the synchronization of markets and large-scale political control.

Resulting in an ever-flowing stream of data, goods, and sophonts: from Core Nobiliti to the proud Aslan Hierate, the enigmatic Zhodani, and the bold Solomani _traders_, each culture brings its own history and vision to the galactic tapestry.
