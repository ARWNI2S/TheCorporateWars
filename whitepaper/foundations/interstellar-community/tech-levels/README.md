# Technological Levels

The **Technology Level (TL)** classifies societies based on their mastery of scientific knowledge, the sophistication of their infrastructure, and their integration into the interstellar network.

From primitive cultures to galactic empires, every civilization exists within a technological spectrum that determines their opportunities, challenges, and relationships with other _polities_.

Technological development not only affects a civilization's capacity for expansion but also defines its place within the interstellar order.

Societies at **TL-9** may be on the verge of an interstellar revolution, while worlds at **TL-5** still rely on fossil resources and terrestrial telecommunications.

The existence of multiple technological levels creates asymmetric power dynamics, where the most advanced civilizations can decide the fate of less developed ones.

Corporations play a key role in this equation, acting as catalysts for development by providing technology and resources in exchange for strategic concessions.

Likewise, they can also hinder the progress of certain worlds to maintain a commercial or pol√≠tical advantage.

In a universe where access to information and mobility defines power, a society's technology level is the determining factor that shapes its influence in the galaxy.
