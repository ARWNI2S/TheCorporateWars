# Tech Zero

Tech Level Zero represents societies that have not yet achieved significant technological development.

Many are tribal cultures, unaware of the existence of other species in the galaxy.

Others are regressed colonies, abandoned, lacking nearby transit stations, or simply without practical manufacturing infrastructure.

Despite their isolation, these worlds do not always go unnoticed by interstellar powers.

Some _Allegiances_ establish exclusion zones to prevent interference in their natural development, while others may view them as potential territories for future colonization or exploitation.

***

For corporations, these worlds often represent long-term opportunities rather than immediate markets, although their galactic position can make them attractive as future expansion outposts.

The impact of _first contact_ can be either devastating or transformative.

An uncontrolled introduction of advanced technologies can destabilize their social evolution, while a gradual process of integration could turn them into valuable long-term allies.
