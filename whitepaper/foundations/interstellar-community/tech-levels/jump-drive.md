# The Jump Drive

**Jump** allows starships to travel between stars by crossing hyperspace, covering between 1 and 6 parsecs in approximately **one week**.

This system does not consume hydrogen as direct fuel, but rather as a source of plasmatic reaction mass. This mass feeds the energy accumulation process required to generate a minimal tachyon field, activated through the ship's lanthanum grid.

At the critical energy point, the tachyon field polarizes into a three-dimensional vector, generating a directed hyperspatial envelope.

During transit, the ship remains completely isolated from realspace: it cannot communicate, receive signals, or be detected by external means. However, the initial jump event leaves a detectable signature: tachyon polarization can be registered by specialized sensors, revealing the direction and magnitude of the vector.

## Why One Week?

> The duration of the jump —approximately 168 standard hours— is independent of the distance traveled.

This is because hyperspatial velocity does not depend on the energy of the jump, but on the harmonic properties of the ship itself.

Theoretically, instantaneous displacement would be possible through tachyons operating under a regime of infinite imaginary mass. However, such a condition disrupts the energetic coherence of realspace, causing critical instabilities such as matter-antimatter microreactions and harmonic collapses, with potentially catastrophic consequences.

To avoid this, the jump drive maintains a controlled relationship between real and imaginary mass. In this balance, lanthanum plays a key role: its properties allow stabilization of the jump field’s resonance frequency.

> Tuning a jump drive is like tuning a musical instrument: small variations in the modulation of the lanthanum grid affect the precision, efficiency, and safety of the transit.

The resulting hyperspatial envelope has fixed properties, determined by the balance between the ship's mass and the structural harmonic resonance of the lanthanum mesh. The induced tachyons force the ship into this domain, where relative velocities and real distances cease to exist.

The perceived transit time —168 hours— results from the build-up of harmonic resonance layers and their natural dissipation periods. Regardless of the magnitude of the jump vector (i.e., the distance), the induced tachyonic resonances dissipate at a constant rate.

Thus, the _effective speed_ of hyperspatial displacement varies with the vector's magnitude, but the total transit duration remains constant for all full jumps.

## Limitations

Interstellar jumps cannot be initiated near gravitational wells or strong electromagnetic sources. To ensure stability, the process must begin at least 100 diameters away from the nearest massive body.

The same applies at the destination: the reentry point must be clear of significant gravitational perturbations. Sublight travel is required both before and after the jump, adding time to the overall journey.
