# Economic Model

**The Corporate Wars** is an economic simulation game set in a persistent, interconnected universe.

Although its economy does not represent real life, its internal behavior is designed to be realistic, creating an ecosystem where player decisions, market dynamics, and political tensions generate emergent consequences on multiple levels.

{% hint style="info" %}
The goal is not just to play with abstract numbers, but to face the challenges of operating in a decentralized environment, where information arrives with delays, prices fluctuate locally, and systemic risks are a natural part of the universe.
{% endhint %}

## Technical Limitations and Blockchain

To sustain this ecosystem, **The Corporate Wars** leverages the Solana blockchain, which allows data to be stored as time-structured records through its proof-of-history system.

Each relevant event — from the state of a planetary market to the outcome of an interstellar trade operation — is recorded in a verifiable ledger, forming the backbone of the persistent universe.

{% hint style="success" %}
This design is not just a technological choice: it is what enables the delayed information model, one of the core foundations of the **The Corporate Wars** universe.
{% endhint %}

Thanks to this time-structured ledger, each star system can operate with the data available in its own context, reflecting the natural latency of interstellar routes.

This means that a player’s decisions do not have immediate or global impact but instead propagate across the universe following the same physical limits that affect trade, diplomacy, or warfare in the game.

### PDA Storage and Sustainability

Worlds, routes, and entities within the **The Corporate Wars** universe are stored as Program Derived Accounts (PDAs) on Solana.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Each PDA carries a cost known as rent, a mechanism of locked tokens that ensures active accounts retain their storage space on the network.
{% endhint %}

The system uses **rent-exempt** accounts, meaning that approximately two years of rent are prepaid, guaranteeing that data remains stored indefinitely even without recent activity.

This design ensures that the historical data of the persistent universe is not lost due to technical or maintenance reasons.

Within the economic model, the algorithms regulating the issuance and circulation of tokens — such as MCr and RU — account for these operational costs.

Thus, the simulated economy is closely aligned with the backend’s sustainability needs, ensuring the long-term viability of both the game and its underlying infrastructure.

## Self-Sustaining Ecosystem

**The Corporate Wars** is built as a self-sustaining economic ecosystem, where the internal dynamics of the universe — markets, prices, production, macroeconomic cycles — adjust algorithmically, without relying on external interventions to maintain balance.

{% hint style="info" %}
The model clearly distinguishes between the virtual economy and the real-world infrastructure that supports it.
{% endhint %}

Within the game, monetary algorithms regulate the supply and circulation of assets, calibrating their purchasing power against an aggregated index of interstellar prices.

Externally, technical costs — such as blockchain storage, PDA maintenance, program execution, and backend services — are covered through treasury held in **SOL**, essential to guarantee the operational stability and continuity of the universe.

Beyond the main monetary pillars, there are key elements such as ownership instruments (functional, not speculative), the advanced markets of the **Interstellar Stock Exchange (ISE)**, and deployment pools that enable growth phases, community coordination, and operations financing.

### MegaCredits (MCr)

The **MCr** is the system’s central SPL Token, equivalent to one million Imperial Credits (Cr) within the game.

{% hint style="info" %}
It functions as an internal algorithmic token based on Hayek Money principles, designed to maintain stable purchasing power against the aggregated prices of the galactic market.
{% endhint %}

MCr are used for trade, contracts, licenses, interstellar transactions, and as a reference base for more complex financial instruments.

Although its primary role is to represent Cr within the universe, its ultimate equilibrium depends on its interaction with the **SOL** infrastructure that supports the ecosystem.

### Resource Units (RU)

**RU (Resource Units)** represent the aggregated wealth of each star system.

They are not individual physical resources but a composite measure integrating factors such as material reserves, production capacity, infrastructure, population living standards, and socioeconomic stability.

{% hint style="info" %}
RU act as planetary backing instruments, estimating not just the material value of a world, but its economic weight within the universe as a whole.
{% endhint %}

Beyond their role as macroeconomic indicators, RU are fundamental in the internal processes governing the universe’s expansion: they are used by the programs that build and update the game’s source of truth, determining the economic weight of each star system, its impact when integrated into the playable galaxy, and the adjustments required in global balances.

Thus, RU allow the universe to expand and evolve coherently, reflecting not just accumulated wealth but active economic potential within the ecosystem.

They also serve as a basis for designing guarantees, risk indices, and other advanced financial calculations, linking their economic role to the instruments of the Interstellar Stock Exchange and the large-scale evolution of the ecosystem.

## Beyond Trade Routes

The economic model of **The Corporate Wars** lays the foundation for a dynamic, self-sustaining, and interconnected environment, where currencies like **MCr** and units like **RU** not only structure internal activity but connect to broader aspects: corporate governance, interstellar financial markets, and expansion toward the fringes of civilization and beyond.

These foundations open the door to understanding how monetary adjustment algorithms operate, how the Interstellar Stock Exchange functions, and how collective mechanisms will shape the next phases of deployment.

More than a closed system, this model marks the beginning of a living, competitive space where every decision can shape alliances, fortunes, and legacies in the shifting tapestry of the universe.

As long as the project remains in the **DevNet** environment, all described systems — including MCr, RU, and any other token or virtual asset — function solely as internal simulation elements, with no real-world economic value outside the testing environment. None of the active systems at this stage have commercial nature nor represent financial assets or investments with real-world value.
