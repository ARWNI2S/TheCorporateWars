# Advanced Mechanics

**The Corporate Wars** is designed with multiple layers of interaction, management, and conflict that intertwine to create a rich, deep, and continuously evolving gameplay experience.

These mechanics include systems for emergent narrative, structural evolution of _Polities_, dynamic diplomacy, interconnected economics, contextual AI, planetary events, and multifaction conflicts, among other elements.

The implementation of these features is modular and progressive, allowing each system to be refined and integrated as it becomes part of the overall game ecosystem.
