# Hierarchical Polities

_Polities_ are organic structures capable of aggregating other _Polities_ under their sphere of control.

This capacity allows for the construction of functional hierarchies: from corporations with multiple subsidiaries to interstellar alliances formed by sovereign worlds, such as the _Allegiances_.

Aggregated _Polities_ become subordinate to the _Polity_ that aggregates them, which defines the relationship parameters, governance, auditing, and shared compliance.

This structure models an emergent collective behavior, structured through principles of composition, integration, and dependency.

***

> _Allegiances_, planetary governments, religious groups, commercial consortia, political parties, revolutionary armies, criminal organizations, pirate networks, nomadic clans, technocratic sects, mercantile federations, scientific foundations, or union blocs...\
> —are all examples of _Polities_ that articulate with one another, forming dynamic ecosystems of power, cooperation, and conflict.

The system does not impose a single form of organization: it accommodates everything from the decentralization of _Allegiances_ —_Vargr Extents_— to vertical hegemonies —_Zhodani Consulate_.

Internal dynamics result from the specific configuration of each hierarchy: delegation of functions, resource distribution, levels of autonomy, or auditing mechanisms.

{% hint style="info" %}
This compositional logic —based on hierarchical integration— is the structural principle of the _Polities_ system and one of the keys to scaling gameplay from local operations to interstellar strategic control.
