# Guilds

Guilds are structured forms of cooperation that operate within the system as active _Polities_, with the same capabilities, rights, and consequences as any other in-game entity.

By establishing themselves as _Polities_, guilds fully participate in the system's hierarchical logic: they can aggregate or be aggregated by other _Polities_, control assets, exercise governance, and respond to dynamics of power, conflict, and cooperation.

The internal structure of each guild is defined by its members â€”ranging from decentralized models based on cultural affinity or shared language to centralized systems with rotating leadership, operational councils, or frameworks inherited from previous organizations.

***

The system recognizes these groups as full-fledged actors within the political and strategic ecosystem of the game, impacting the narrative cycles of their members and shaping strategies of collaboration and competition among them.

They may compete for influence, establish operational zones, intervene in local conflicts, or negotiate agreements with other _Polities_.
