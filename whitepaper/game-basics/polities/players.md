# Corporations are Polities

Corporations operate as sovereign actors within the political and strategic fabric of Known Space.

As the game progresses, corporations can **govern worlds**, establish **holdings**, fund **subsidiaries**, and progressively engage in gameplay systems that were initially hidden, inaccessible, or perceived as exclusive domains of the AI.

Proper performance and balanced development of a corporation will allow, through distinct narrative cycles, the exploration of all gameplay possibilities.

## Game Actors

_Polities_ are the foundational entities through which we model gameplay: they share internal structures and follow common principles of composition, aggregation, and dependency.

A corporation as a _Polity_ allows for the structural application of gameplay principles, logic, and mechanics, integrating all levels of metagame from this layer and enabling players to interact with the game universe via data visualization, tuning, and control interfaces.

This design allows the AI to treat all _Polities_ as actors grouped into leadership hierarchies—factions, clans, groups, sides—with varying degrees of autonomy, responsibility, and governance, enabling the system to contextualize narrative cycles and adjust autonomous gameplay strategies based on player participation.

_Allegiances_ and _Institutions_ controlled by the system's AI aggregate numerous player-controlled corporations, which are treated as _assets_ in practical terms and participate in high-level strategies deployed by the AI for those factions.

> Corporations in the **Third Imperium** function as instruments of stabilization; those from the **Two Thousand Worlds**, as vectors of expansion and development. Each _Allegiance_ has its own gameplay, shaped by dynamic narrative cycles emerging from AI-applied strategies.

In the absence of players, the AI deploys its own corporate actors—megacorporations and long-range corporate conglomerates—to develop synthetic balance strategies for the game if necessary.
