# Corporations are Polities

In **The Corporate Wars**, corporations are not mere commercial entities —they are full-fledged _**Polities**_.

This means they operate as sovereign actors within the political and strategic fabric of the galaxy.

They can **govern worlds**, establish **holdings**, create and control **subsidiaries**, and actively participate in the balance of power across sectors and regions.

Like other _Polities_ —such as empires, federations, or noble houses— corporations can form alliances, declare conflicts, sign treaties, or manipulate markets.

Their decisions have direct consequences on the galactic environment and the lives of millions of citizens.

As they grow, corporations can aggregate into **power blocs**, influencing key sectors, interfering with local governments, and even **affecting the structure of Imperial nobility**.

Controlling a corporation is not just about profit —it means taking an active role in the political metagame, from the economic foundation of Interstellar Society to its aristocratic pinnacle.
