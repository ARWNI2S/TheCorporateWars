# Galactic Council of Sciences

The **Galactic Council of Sciences** is a supracultural institution dedicated to the recognition, documentation, and preservation of formal knowledge across Charted Space.

Its origins date back to the first inter-species contacts during the Ziru Sirka era. Although its structure has evolved over the millennia, it retains symbolic and academic authority that transcends species, cultures, and governments.

The Council grants legitimacy to scientific discoveries, technological breakthroughs, and foundational theories, provided they are publicly documented, verifiably replicable, and registered according to intersystem patent protocols.

Its archives are protected by multijurisdictional treaties and regularly consulted by universities, corporations, governments, and subscribed entities. While it exercises no control over ownership, its validation grants academic priority, institutional access, and strategic visibility.

For certain _Allegiances_, Council recognition is a formal requirement for the legal exploitation of sensitive technologies or the approval of scientific methodologies.

## The Council in the Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, the **Galactic Council of Sciences** represents a source of validation, prestige, and intellectual influence.

Players can interact with the Council to register discoveries, secure patents, or validate technologies before third parties.

{% hint style="success" %}
Council recognition unlocks mechanical benefits such as bonuses to academic reputation, preference in scientific tenders, legal protection in intellectual property disputes, and even access to grants or transstellar research programs.
{% endhint %}

The Council may also act as a neutral arbiter in scientific conflicts or as a source of research contracts, enabling players to leverage technical achievements as tools for diplomacy, propaganda, or commerce.

It holds no military or executive power, but its validation can tip the balance in large-scale political, economic, or epistemological disputes.
