# Established Institutions

In Charted Space, there are **Established Institutions** that are not aligned with any specific _Allegiance_.

These institutions are timeless and have been upheld by various civilizations throughout the history of Interstellar Society.

Some of these institutions originate from legacy agreements between _Allegiances_ over time, establishing traditions for trade, exploration, and military intervention.

Others have emerged from sustained practice, technical prestige, or the accumulated trust of their participants, consolidating themselves as legitimate actors without the need for formal backing.

## In-Game Establishment

For corporations in **The Corporate Wars**, these institutions can represent both a bureaucratic obstacle and a strategic tool.

They regulate contracts, conduct arbitration, or oversee industrial standards to ensure interoperability within the interstellar economy.

Their degree of authority varies by region, and in some cases, they are little more than symbolic figures with no real enforcement capability without the support of _Allegiances_ and governments.

Complying with their regulations and obtaining their endorsement can grant access to exclusive markets and legal protections, while operating outside their framework carries significant risks, ranging from sanctions to trade blockades or direct interventions.
