# Interstellar Stock Exchange

The Interstellar Stock Exchange is an ancient institution that regulates, centralizes, and certifies the valuation of assets, shares, and financial derivatives on an intersystem scale.

> Founded in a previous era, its exact origin was lost during the _Long Night_. Some records trace it back to the time of the Ziru Sirka, others to even earlier periods, possibly linked to myths of the Precursors — _Vilani propaganda, according to the BIS_.

It has operated for millennia with recognized jurisdiction across connected sectors and is supported by a network of agencies and clearinghouses distributed along current trade routes.

Its structure is designed to maintain coherence between systems separated by weeks of travel, relying on verification nodes, replication protocols, and arbitration agents who travel along jump routes.
