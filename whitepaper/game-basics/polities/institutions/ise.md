# Interstellar Stock Exchange

The **Interstellar Stock Exchange** is a millennia-old institution that regulates, centralizes, and certifies the valuation of assets, shares, and financial derivatives on an intersystem scale.

> Founded in a prior era, its exact origin has been lost during the _Long Night_. Some records place it in the times of the Ziru Sirka, others in even earlier periods, occasionally linked to myths of the Precursors —_Vilani propaganda, according to the BIS_.

It has operated for millennia with recognized jurisdiction across connected sectors, sustained by a network of agencies and clearinghouses distributed along current trade routes.

Its structure is designed to maintain coherence between systems separated by weeks of transit, using verification nodes, replication protocols, and arbitration agents who travel along jump routes.

The ISE maintains two units of value: a non-circulating structural value unit, tied to worlds —the Resource Units—; and a circulating, digital, algorithmically stabilized unit —known as the MegaCredit in the Third Imperium and the Solomani Sphere.

The stability of both values depends on their role as reference frameworks, not on market perceptions. Their value does not fluctuate: they are absolute scales by which economic activity is measured. Just as the second measures time, the RU measures _effective access_ to resources, and the MCr measures _capitalization capacity_.

### Ancestral Esoterica

In Vilani culture, the _Ashgiid_ is a socio-economic-philosophical concept, almost religious in nature, representing a **universal equation of civilization**, akin to unified physics models applied to sophontological analysis.

According to the _Dulkigash Makhidum_ —from the original Vilani, _The Endurance of Value_— Interstellar Society is defined by a Technological Level of equivalent reach in all domains; according to the most accepted interpretation of the poem, this refers to socio-economic development also on an interstellar scale.

> "...evolving sophonts face the _Makhidulir_ —the manifestation of value— when _Kishidur_ and _Kashadur_ are reconciled within the framework of the _Ashgiid_, the unique algorithm underlying all lasting interaction. Its components, the _Ashma_, are not instructions but mirrors of distributed rational behavior."

> "...Ziru Sirka encountered sophonts who had resolved _Ashma_ through their own _Makhidin_, organically aligned with the _Ashgiid_, revealing its inevitability..."

Another example is the _Durumaz_, a mathematical poem describing the _Ashgiid_ across more than half a million verses in _Zhaagim_, a complex mathematical language from eras prior to the Ziru Sirka.

Striking parallels can be found between the _Durumaz_ and the unified algorithms used by the ISE, giving the Vilani poem a prophetic quality from the standpoint of algorithmic analysis.

It is unclear whether, due to its millennia-old connection, the ISE adopted Vilani philosophies, or whether it was the Ziru Sirka that integrated the ISE into its cultural references.

## ISE in the Game

The **Interstellar Stock Exchange** functions as a transversal economic mechanic in **The Corporate Wars**, accessible to any _Polity_ that adopts its logic and can validate its values.

Entities can operate within the ISE if they control RUs or have access to decentralized currencies backed by MCr.

These conditions determine which actors can list assets, execute interstellar transactions, or finance operations at scale.

The system reflects a decentralized mathematical balance, but not a neutral one: desynchronization and fragmented information between worlds introduce uncertainty, speculation, and maneuvering room for those who control key nodes or dominate data flow.

Players may use the ISE as a capital source, as a framework of institutional support, or as a financial battlefield —where arbitrage, manipulation, and economic intelligence become tools of power.
