# Laws and Rules

Despite efforts to maintain order, the vastness of space and communication barriers make law enforcement inconsistent.

In the farthest frontiers, the influence of major governments fades, giving rise to territories where authority is contested by factions, pirates, militias, and corporate consortia.

In this environment, compliance with the law is often a matter of pragmatism, and survival depends on the ability to navigate the complex dynamics of interstellar power.

***

> Laws in _The Corporate Wars_ emerge from the interplay between Governments, _Allegiances_, and _Institutions_.

Governments determine the type of authority that prevails in a system; _Allegiances_ define whom that authority answers to, and _Institutions_ —interstellar, local, or private— impose concrete rules that regulate trade, transit, and property.

The result is a mosaic of legal systems, where each world has its own rules about who can act, what is permitted, and what constitutes a crime.

Breaking these rules can trigger specific consequences: sanctions, embargoes, confiscations, customs blockades, or armed intervention.

A breached contract at one port may become an arrest warrant in another —or go unpunished if it crosses jurisdictions lacking common treaties.

Understanding and manipulating these legal dynamics is part of the game: knowing when to register an operation, when to bribe a bureaucrat, or when to delete a cargo manifest can mean the difference between expanding or being dismantled.
