# Law Level

Each government enforces the law according to its own interpretation and institutional capacity, resulting in different **Law Levels** across worlds and jurisdictions.

A low Law Level implies tolerance, neglect, or lack of enforcement capacity; a high Law Level indicates strict control, constant oversight, and severe punishments.

However, law exists regardless of how strictly it is applied: violations may be ignored by one local authority and pursued by another.

Shared databases, interstellar transmissions, and traffic logs allow institutions to cross-reference information and coordinate responses.

***

In this environment, agents, patrols, inspectors, and officers operate with legal authority.

They may stop, investigate, seize, or penalize depending on the context. Some act out of duty; others, under contract or commission.

Being discovered carries practical and strategic consequences: fines, embargoes, lockdowns, loss of reputation, revoked licenses, arrests, or asset seizures.
