# Third Imperium

The **Third Imperium**, founded in year 0 of the Imperial Calendar, represents the greatest effort of civilizational unification in known history.

Heir to earlier structures—the Vilani _Ziru Sirka_ and the Solomani _Rule of Man_—the Third Imperium stands upon a synthesis of tradition, pragmatism, and technological supremacy.

At its core lies a feudal technocracy: the **Emperor** delegates authority to a vast network of nobles, bureaucrats, and institutions that regulate trade, law, and interstellar warfare, maintaining a delicate balance between imperial centralization and planetary autonomy.

### Structure and Governance

Each world within the Third Imperium governs itself according to its own laws and customs, provided it acknowledges the Emperor as sovereign, pays its agreed tribute, and allows imperial presence where strategically necessary.

This autonomy is aligned with an imperial institutional network that exerts influence between worlds—a structure invisible in the void, yet present at every port, along every jump route, and at every key node.

Developed worlds, sector capitals, or industrial enclaves often host permanent seats of these institutions, becoming focal points where the Third Imperium manifests visibly and directly.

### Imperial Culture

Imperial society is divided into functional layers. At the base are local citizens, governed by the laws of their homeworld.

Above them, imperial subjects enjoy common rights and responsibilities across interstellar space.

The nobility, holding legal and economic authority, manages territories, titles, and resources.

Beyond this classical hierarchy, corporations have been elevated to the status of political entities, operating with interstate autonomy within the legal framework of the Imperium.

Although the Third Imperium is built upon a rigid hierarchical structure, it permits remarkable cultural and religious diversity—so long as it does not threaten institutional cohesion or the flow of information, trade, and power.

## The Third Imperium in the Game

In *The Corporate Wars*, the Third Imperium is a setting, not a controllable actor. Its power is not directly enforced, but its influence is everywhere.

Interactions with it take the form of contracts with its institutions, diplomatic disputes between recognized worlds, battles over subsidized routes, covert operations to preserve stability, or efforts to gain recognition, licenses, or favor from its bureaucracy.

Even the most powerful actors do not control the Third Imperium—but all operate in its shadow, seeking to influence it, avoid it, or survive beneath its gaze.
