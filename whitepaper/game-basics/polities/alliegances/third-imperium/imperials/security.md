# Bureau of Imperial Security

The Bureau of Imperial Security (BIS) is the agency responsible for protecting the institutional integrity of the Third Imperium against internal threats, espionage, subversion, and the leakage of sensitive information.

Unlike the Navy or the Ministry of Justice, its mandate is neither public nor transparent —and its very presence on a world can generate tension or paranoia.

The BIS operates both within and beyond Imperial territory.

Its agents —often undercover or embedded within other institutions— monitor nobles, corporations, local governments, and even fellow Imperial agencies.

Wherever there is a risk of corruption, sedition, or the loss of strategic data, the BIS may intervene without warning.

While the Bureau reports directly to the Emperor, many of its operations are conducted by **decentralized cells**, with high levels of operational autonomy and access to restricted communication channels —often outdated or deliberately isolated to preserve mission continuity and compartmentalization.

The Bureau also maintains complex relationships with foreign powers: from counterintelligence missions within Zhodani territory to infiltration of Vargr criminal networks, and silent information wars against independent corporate clans.

## The BIS in the Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, the Bureau of Imperial Security is a powerful and ambiguous force.

It may act as relentless pursuer, covert patron, or privileged source of intelligence —depending on how players position themselves in relation to Imperial authority.

Collaborating with the BIS can grant access to classified data, protected routes, or temporary immunity.

But it also brings scrutiny, political risk, and the constant danger of being used as pawns in high-stakes covert operations.

Ignoring its existence won't make it go away; in fact, the most successful corporations are often those that understand **when to cooperate, when to resist** —**and when to vanish from the records**.

In the Imperium, information is power. And the BIS decides who holds it.
