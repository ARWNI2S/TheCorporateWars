# Imperial Armed Forces

The Armed Forces of the Third Imperium are the military instrument through which imperial hegemony is protected, projected, and preserved across Charted Space.

Their structure reflects the technocratic and decentralized character of the Imperium, acting more as guardians of interstellar stability than as a direct occupation force over individual worlds.

## The Imperial Navy

The Navy is the backbone of imperial power.

It operates war fleets, escorts mail routes, enforces blockades, patrols disputed zones, and projects force in times of crisis or disobedience.

Though formally subordinate to the Emperor, in practice its admirals exercise significant operational autonomy.

The Navy controls orbital stations, armories, academies, and bases at key transit points.

### Imperial Marine Infantry

The Imperial Marines are specialized forces trained for boarding actions, orbital assaults, rapid response, and the control of strategic installations.

They act as a shock force when precision entry and exit are required.

They travel aboard Navy vessels and are deployed in situations that demand direct action under the imperial banner.

### The Army

The Imperial Army, unlike the Marine Infantry, is designed for extended ground operations.

Its mission is not to conquer worlds, but to stabilize regions, support loyal governments, secure critical infrastructure, and serve as a temporary occupation force in high-risk scenarios.

Its presence is usually exceptional and time-limited.

## The Imperial Armed Forces in the Game

The imperial forces are not at the players' command.

They may act as allies, adversaries, or neutral parties depending on the group's actions and circumstances.

Sometimes they protect, other times they pursue, and occasionally they require cooperation.

But they are never directly controlled.

They represent the sword of the Third Imperium â€”a superior force that imposes order, but whose will does not always align with the players' interests.
