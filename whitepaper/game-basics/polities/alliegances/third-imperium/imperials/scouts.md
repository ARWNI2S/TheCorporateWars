# Imperial Interstellar Scout Service

Once a cradle of adventurers, today the Exploration Service is an administrative and bureaucratic institution.

After fully completing the Second Survey, it dedicated itself to strengthening and modernizing the Imperial Mail routes, delegating much of its field activity to the private sector.

### Imperial Edict 1143.1

In the year 1143, the First Imperial Edict was the approval and entry into force of private explorer licenses, issued by the Exploration Service under the Authority of the Emperor.

This policy formalized the Interstellar Exploration Service as an Imperial authority, increasing the reach and prestige of the institution.

As a consequence, it is the private sector, specialized freelancers, and corporations who carry out the reconnaissance and first contact missions in remote systems.

This has led the Exploration Service to establish a precedent of **astrographic business** beyond the borders of the empire, from deep space merchants to Zhodani corporations, Aslan clans, and Vargr, all have appreciated the **value** of trading with updated data of the galaxy.
