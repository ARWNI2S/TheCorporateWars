# Imperial Ministry of Commerce

The Imperial Ministry of Commerce (IMC) is the agency responsible for regulating, licensing, and overseeing all commercial activity that crosses planetary borders within the space of the Third Imperium.

Its core mission is to **ensure economic interoperability** between worlds, cultures, corporations, and technologies —not by imposing a single model, but by guaranteeing that all actors operate under shared rules.

The IMC issues operational licenses to corporations seeking to trade, establish routes, open branches, or participate in interplanetary consortia.

This applies to both Imperial firms and foreign entities —all must register, declare their legal nature, and comply with established protocols.

The Ministry does not set prices or dictate economic models, but it does establish standards, validate contracts, mediate disputes, and regulate access to subsidized routes, free zones, and logistical platforms.

Its offices are present at most major starports and Imperial diplomatic outposts.

There, one can find inspectors, contract notaries, auditors, and liaison agents coordinating with other institutions.

## The IMC in the Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, the Ministry of Commerce is the key point of contact for any corporation aiming to operate on an interstellar scale.

Without an IMC license, no commercial activity is legal —whether it's transport, trade, finance, or resource exploitation.

Players interact with this institution constantly: requesting permits, defending contracts, negotiating route access, or maneuvering around burdensome regulations.

In many cases, the Ministry acts more as an arbiter than an adversary.

But its signature is essential for any business to be legitimate within the Imperium.

And in the Imperium, **what isn't licensed... is smuggling**.
