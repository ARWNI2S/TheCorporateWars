# Imperial Treasury

The Imperial Treasury is the agency responsible for the collection, allocation, and oversight of the Third Imperium’s economic resources. Its role is not to manage the internal economies of individual worlds —each planet retains its own fiscal systems— but to oversee the macroeconomic flows that sustain the Imperium as an interstellar entity.

The Treasury collects tribute and fees for the use of Imperial routes, trade licenses, diplomatic services, notarial records, and the legal validation of major contracts. It also administers the funds allocated for subsidized mail routes, diplomatic missions, or strategic interventions.

Unlike other institutions, the Treasury does not deal directly with individuals or small organizations. Its interactions are limited to planetary governments and **corporations with significant stakes in Imperial routes or infrastructure**.

The Treasury maintains a physical presence in sector capitals, major logistical hubs, and high-level administrative centers. From there, it coordinates inspections, audits, and long-range macroeconomic negotiations.

## The Treasury in the Game

For players, the Treasury is not an everyday actor —but it can be a decisive one.

Controlling a strategic route or participating in a key market may draw its attention, opening doors to subsidies, legal backing, or inclusion in Imperial consortia… or exposing players to audits, tax pressures, and regulatory scrutiny.

In **The Corporate Wars**, the Treasury is neither a military nor political authority. But it’s the one that signs the budgets. And without a budget, nothing moves in the Imperium.
