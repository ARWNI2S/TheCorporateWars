# Imperial Ministry of Justice

The Imperial Ministry of Justice is the institution responsible for enforcing and upholding Imperial law throughout the territory controlled by the Third Imperium.

Unlike local courts —which rule according to their respective planetary laws— the Ministry acts as a **supralegal authority**, tasked with resolving interstellar disputes, cases involving Imperial jurisdiction, and conflicts that transcend the scope of a single world.

The Ministry does not maintain a physical court system on every planet.

Instead, it operates through a network of **Imperial agents with judicial authority**, who may serve as prosecutors, itinerant judges, or legal arbiters acting in the name of the Emperor.

These agents are often also officers of the Imperial Navy, agents of the Department of Security, or representatives of the Throne in sensitive matters.

One of the Ministry's key roles is the **adjudication of disputes between worlds, nobles, corporations, or Imperial institutions**.

From transport contract claims to disagreements over exploitation rights, any conflict with interstellar relevance can be brought before the Ministry.

Additionally, the Ministry manages a **system of appeals and petitions**, through which Imperial citizens, corporations, or even planetary governments may request a review of local rulings if they believe their Imperial rights have been violated.

## The Ministry of Justice in the Game

The Ministry of Justice provides a powerful narrative tool. Players (including AI-controlled factions) may turn to this institution to appeal planetary rulings, file lawsuits against powerful entities, or seek immunity, arbitration, or legal protection in times of crisis.

It can be a bureaucratic ally, an inflexible obstacle, or a legal sword that falls without warning.

In the game, the Ministry becomes a key actor: a place where players may defend their interests... or lose everything in a single ruling.

In **The Corporate Wars**, Imperial justice isn't always fair —but it's always final.
