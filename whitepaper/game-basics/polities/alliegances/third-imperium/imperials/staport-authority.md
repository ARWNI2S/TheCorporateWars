# Starport Authority

The Imperial Starport Authority (SPA) is a cornerstone institution of the logistical and commercial infrastructure of interstellar civilization. Its responsibility does not lie in exploration, defense, or direct political administration, but in something more fundamental: **keeping the nodes where the worlds of the Imperium connect fully operational**.

Established as an autonomous entity under Imperial charter, the SPA supervises and regulates all certified starports—critical facilities for ship traffic, legal trade, passenger transit, cargo handling, and interstellar customs enforcement.

Its structure is designed to function in cooperation with planetary governments. On most worlds, Imperial starports operate under joint administration: the infrastructure belongs to the planet, but technical oversight, regulatory compliance, and space traffic control fall under the SPA’s jurisdiction. On key worlds, the SPA maintains a **direct presence**, with offices, inspectors, and its own security forces.

Traffic protocols, docking codes, cargo services, and inspection procedures are standardized throughout the Imperium—a ship can jump from system to system and always find the same landing interface, the same warning signs, and the same baseline rules.

On the fringes, the SPA is one of the most visible faces of the Imperium. A functional starport not only signals access to trade and maintenance—it also implies **legal status and recognition** within the Imperial network.

## The SPA in the Game

The Starport Authority is one of the most direct and frequent points of interaction between player-run corporations and the Third Imperium.

Every ship operating in Imperial Space depends on the SPA’s services, permits, and regulations.

Players may confront it, collaborate with its officials, or exploit its structures to smuggle, negotiate, establish routes, or influence planetary governments.

Jurisdictional disputes, administrative favors, and SPA contacts can become valuable resources—or critical obstacles.

Additionally, starports are **economic, social, and strategic hubs**: centers of trade, logistical choke points, meeting grounds for contractors, and the setting for countless opportunities—and dangers.

In **The Corporate Wars**, the SPA is not just an authority: it’s a playable environment in its own right.
