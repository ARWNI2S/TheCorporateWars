# Imperial University

The Imperial University is the oldest and most prestigious educational institution in the Third Imperium.

Although its original campus is located on Capital, it maintains branches, affiliated academies, and accreditation programs across thousands of Imperial worlds.

More than a university in the modern sense, it is a **knowledge validation network**, tasked with preserving, disseminating, and updating technical, scientific, and cultural knowledge aligned with Imperial standards.

Its faculties train not only officials, engineers, and scientists, but also administrators, pilots, diplomats, and agents capable of operating in complex interplanetary environments.

Beyond its educational function, the Imperial University plays a key role in local technological and social development: wherever its programs are implemented, tech literacy improves, labor conditions rise, and the **Tech Level** increases without the need to import external talent or infrastructure.

## The University in the Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, educational systems —especially the presence of the Imperial University— have a direct impact on local development.

A world with access to accredited education produces more qualified labor, improving industrial efficiency, reducing costs, and accelerating Tech Level advancement without relying on imported experts or equipment.

This allows corporations to operate with greater autonomy and competitiveness on those planets.

Additionally, access to higher education can unlock technologies, enhance research capabilities, or even shift the balance of power across entire regions.
