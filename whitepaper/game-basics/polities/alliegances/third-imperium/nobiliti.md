# Nobiliti

The Nobiliti is the aristocratic class of the Third Imperium.

Its existence is neither symbolic nor decorative: it constitutes one of the foundational pillars of the Imperial system.

Nobles do not merely hold titles �they carry legal responsibilities, territorial jurisdiction, and duties of loyalty to the Emperor.

Their authority derives from Imperial grants, and their role is to guarantee stability, development, and the continuity of interstellar order.

### Noble Houses

Imperial noble houses are hereditary lineages with centuries �sometimes millennia� of history.

They may have Sylean, Solomani, Vilani, Vargr, or other origins, often combining genetic heritage with political or economic acquisitions.

These houses maintain influence networks that include marriage alliances, corporate ties, control of trade routes, and direct access to other Imperial institutions.

Each house holds a **rank** (ducal, marquisate, baronial, etc.) and a **jurisdiction**, which may range from a single planet to entire sectors, depending on its importance.

## Imperial Domains

Imperial Domains are large administrative regions encompassing multiple sectors under the authority of an Archduke. They represent the effective decentralization of Imperial power.

These domains function as semi-autonomous zones within the Imperium, capable of organizing local fleets, appointing officials, and maintaining order.

## Nobiliti in the Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, the Nobiliti is a source of authority, conflict, and opportunity.

Players may **gain the favor** of a Noble House to access protected trade routes, secure protection, or gain legitimacy.

They might **clash with local nobles** in political or economic disputes.

Or they may find their progress **blocked by lineages** that control key sectors of commerce, diplomacy, or infrastructure.

The Nobiliti is not something players can control �it must be managed.

And one wrong move against the wrong noble can have... _Imperial_ consequences.
