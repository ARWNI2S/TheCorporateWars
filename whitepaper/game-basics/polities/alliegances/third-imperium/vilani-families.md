# Ziru Sirka

The Ziru Sirka is not an Imperial institution —it is a cultural, historical, and corporate _alliegance_ deeply rooted in Vilani identity.

Heirs of the First Interstellar Empire, the families and corporations aligned with the Ziru Sirka maintain parallel power structures, distinct philosophies, and a vision of the Imperium as the natural continuation of their civilizing legacy.

Although they swear loyalty to the Emperor, many within the Ziru Sirka believe that Imperial rule should be in the hands of those who originally forged it: the Vilani houses.

This tension —often latent— defines the Ziru Sirka as an **internal faction** of the Third Imperium: not in open rebellion, but in constant competition for influence, prestige, and ideological direction.

## Structure and Power

The Ziru Sirka is organized around **extended families functioning as lineage** _**consortia**_ **and megacorporations**.

These groups control key trade routes, logistical infrastructure, and cultural hubs.

Many members of the Nobiliti also belong to Vilani houses, blurring the lines between institution and allegiance.

Some of these houses promote pragmatic coexistence with other Imperial cultures.

Others —especially the more conservative branches— aspire to a gradual restoration of the old Vilani order.

### The Ziru Sirka and the Interstellar Stock Exchange

It’s unclear whether the Ziru Sirka founded the Interstellar Stock Exchange, if it existed before their rise, or if they simply absorbed it over the centuries.

What is clear is that Vilani houses and consortia linked to the Ziru Sirka hold long-standing, highly profitable financial positions within this system.

These millennia-old investments, passed down through generations, have made the Ziru Sirka an economic pillar —not just of the Imperium, but of all Charted Space.

During the Fall of the First Imperium and the Terran rule of the Rule of Man, the Ziru Sirka suffered catastrophic losses. Its power fragmented, many fortunes evaporated, and its institutional influence waned.

However, under the Third Imperium, it has begun a slow but steady recovery. Thanks to their cultural, corporate, and aristocratic connections, Vilani houses have been able to restore some of their holdings and regain strategic market presence.

In practical terms, these are **fortunes that have grown for millennia** —the real-world equivalent would be as if the "galactic bitcoin" had been accumulated and capitalized without interruption for over 7,000 years.

This financial power explains why the Ziru Sirka never disappears from the galactic stage: even when it loses political or military influence, **its assets generate interstellar profits beyond comparison**, ensuring its structural resilience through the ages.

## The Ziru Sirka in the Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, the Ziru Sirka is not merely a cultural faction: it is an ancient, living infrastructure of power operating within the Third Imperium.

Interacting with the Ziru Sirka means dealing with the Vilani aristocracy, the oldest consortia, the most influential lobbies, and the deepest financial networks in Charted Space.

Its actors can be valuable allies for large-scale projects —if you share their vision and respect their hierarchy— or insurmountable obstacles to any attempt at disruptive innovation or power redistribution.

Through its houses, corporations, and databanks, the Ziru Sirka can: fund initiatives, secure trade routes, block rivals, infiltrate institutional structures, or simply wait centuries until an adversary fades away.

For players, joining —or opposing— the Ziru Sirka is stepping into a chess game where every piece carries thousands of years of history, and where power is rarely exercised with direct violence, but always with definitive consequences.

### Karaamshidukagim (The Corporate Wars)

The Vilani houses of the Ziru Sirka are reviving this ancient form of corporate conflict, invoking the war laws of the Third Imperium. Not as treason against the Imperium, but as its civilizing regulation.
