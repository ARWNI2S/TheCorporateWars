# Alliegances

**Allegiances** —the _factions_ of the political metagame— represent the interstellar powers of the universe.

They regulate, influence, or condition all aspects of galactic life, organizing themselves into complex networks of **internal institutions** to maintain their reach and efficiency.

An _Allegiance_ may have other minor _Allegiances_ under its orbit, either as affiliates, allies, or subjugated entities.

In addition to the great powers, there are _**pocket empires**_, **leagues**, **regional alliances**, and **client states**, among many others recognized as valid forms of _Allegiance_.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Every legitimate _Allegiance_ controls at least **two worlds and a jump route** between them, granting it territorial presence and operational capacity.
{% endhint %}

***

Functionally, allegiances operate **bottom-up** in terms of internal organization, and **top-down** in the application of authority and compliance auditing.

Major _Allegiances_ —due to their historical weight and role in the overall balance of the universe— **cannot be directly controlled by players**, although they **can be influenced** indirectly through minor _Allegiances_ or internal institutions.

These structures define the astropolitical board on which **The Corporate Wars** unfolds.
