# Allegiances

**Allegiances** —the _factions_ of the political metagame— represent the interstellar powers of the universe.

They regulate, influence, or constrain all aspects of galactic life, organizing themselves into complex networks of **internal institutions** to maintain reach and efficiency.

An Allegiance may have other, smaller Allegiances under its sphere of influence —whether as affiliates, allies, or subjugated powers.

In addition to the major powers, there are **pocket empires**, **leagues**, **regional alliances**, and **client states**, among many others recognized as valid forms of Allegiance.

Every legitimate Allegiance controls at least **two worlds and a jump route** between them, granting it both territorial presence and operational capability.

***

Functionally, institutions and sub-allegiances tend to operate **bottom-up** in internal matters (regulation, representation) and **top-down** in external affairs (borders, diplomacy, defense).

Major Allegiances —due to their historical weight and role in the balance of power— **cannot be directly controlled by players**, but they **can be influenced** indirectly through minor Allegiances or internal institutions.

These structures define the geopolitical landscape in which **The Corporate Wars** unfolds.
