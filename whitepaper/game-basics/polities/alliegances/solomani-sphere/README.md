# Solomani Confederation

The **Solomani Confederation** is an interstellar power bound by a political and cultural doctrine that upholds the primacy of humanity originating from Earth.

Despite being defeated in the last _Imperial War_ —known in the Third Imperium as the _Solomani Rim War_— and losing control over Sol, the Confederation not only survived: it rebuilt its sphere of influence through a mix of pragmatism, ideology, and strategic presence.

By the year 1201, it maintains a federal bloc of worlds aligned with its vision, an evolving institutional structure, and a doctrinal apparatus capable of projecting power beyond its recognized borders.

Its legitimacy draws from both its historical legacy and its present-day ability to intervene, infiltrate, or shape the galactic board according to its interests.

### Doctrine and Projection

The Confederation is grounded in a core ideological tenet: that humans originating from Earth are the rightful heirs to galactic order.

This doctrine permeates its institutions, foreign policy, intelligence apparatus (the **SolSec**), and its ties to sympathetic enclaves and corporations.

Every economic expansion, tactical alliance, or covert operation is presented as an act of restoration.

The Confederation does not seek to dominate out of imperial ambition, but out of historical conviction: legitimate _Humaniti_ must reclaim its rightful place.

The Solomani Confederation maintains a stable network of loyal sectors, diplomatic influence along its borders, and doctrinal presence across multiple fronts. It is a patient, strategic, and ideologically driven _Allegiance_.

## The Solomani Confederation in the Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, the Solomani Confederation operates as a commercial coalition with a **transnational ideological system**, willing to support or absorb any _Polity_ that aligns with its principles.

Its tools of projection include doctrinal pacts, cultural alignment programs, and **SolSec** operations that infiltrate, manipulate, or sustain key actors without the need for direct control.

A corporation aligned with Solomanism not only gains access to resources and protection—it adopts a historical mission.

The benefits are real —preferential bids, support networks, coordinated campaigns, influence trafficking— but always framed within a larger narrative that justifies every action as part of a restorative process.

From the perspective of other _Allegiances_, the Solomani Confederation commands respect, distrust, or admiration.

Playing with it means embracing a powerful, cohesive, and _totalizing_ vision that gives strategic meaning to _Humaniti_'s place in the galaxy.
