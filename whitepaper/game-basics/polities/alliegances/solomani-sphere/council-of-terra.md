# Council of Terra

The **Council of Terra** is the highest authority of the **Solomani Confederation**, embodying both institutional continuity and its historic mission. Though its original seat in Sol was lost during the Frontier War, the Council continues to operate in exile with full political, doctrinal, and symbolic legitimacy.

More than a mere governing body, the Council of Terra is the guardian of Solomani core ideology: Humanity, native to Earth, was not defeated but dispossessed. Every act of the Confederation — from diplomatic treaties to covert operations — is part of an inevitable process of restoration.

## Historical Continuity

The Council's existence dates back to the early days of humanity’s expansion into space, with roots that span Vilani dominance, the Rule of Man, and the Interstellar Wars. It survived the fall of the Second Imperium and preserved the vision of a unified humanity under Terran leadership.

Since the founding of the Confederation in 871, the Council has served as its central axis. Following the loss of Sol in 1002, its role strengthened as a symbol of resistance and guarantor of the Solomani historical project.

Every directive, policy, and intervention reflects a singular goal: the complete reintegration of Sol’s legacy.

## In-Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, the Council of Terra functions as the supreme doctrinal authority within the Solomani _Loyalty_. It defines strategic direction, legitimizes subordinate _Polities_, and dictates the acceptable ethical, cultural, and geopolitical parameters.

Any corporation, world, or agent aligned with the Confederation responds — directly or indirectly — to its guidance. Interacting with its envoys means navigating the weight of history, Solomani orthodoxy, and a restorative vision of galactic order.

It is, in essence, the voice of Sol — even in exile.
