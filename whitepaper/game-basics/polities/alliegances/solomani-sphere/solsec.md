# SolSec

**SolSec** —short for _Solomani Security_— is the doctrinal oversight, strategic intelligence, and ideological control apparatus of the Solomani _Loyalty_.

Originally founded as a state agency during the early centuries of the Confederation, it now operates as a decentralized, autonomous network with the capacity to act across all fronts of the corporate conflict.

In the current ecosystem, SolSec enforces the foundational principles of Solomanism, sanctions strategic or ideological deviations, and directly commissions aligned corporations to carry out key operations.

More than a secret police, SolSec is a _doctrinal nervous system_: invisible, ubiquitous, and absolutely lethal when activated.

## Nature and Functions

SolSec formally reports to the **Terran Council**, but operates with complete operational independence.

It maintains black fleets, classified AIs, private data networks, and active cells across multiple sectors.

Its internal structure is organized around functional goals: _infiltration_, _surveillance_, _rectification_, _doctrinal analysis_, and _covert operations_ in external theaters of influence.

Its focus is not territorial defense, but narrative control: ensuring that every action taken in the name of the Confederation —whether by a local government or a transnational corporation— reinforces the restorative vision of Solomanism.

Any deviation —ethical, cultural, or technological— may be subject to intervention if it threatens doctrinal continuity.

## SolSec In-Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, **SolSec** can directly shape the players' narrative.

It **validates** alliances, **assigns doctrinal missions** to aligned corporations, and **punishes** strategic deviation.

It can infiltrate competitors, sabotage research, or force political alignment.

Accepting its support means accepting non-negotiable ideological clauses. Refusing it means operating under constant scrutiny.

SolSec is not confronted in open conflict —it is bargained with, served... or evaded, if one dares.
