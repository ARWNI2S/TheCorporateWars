# Driantia Zhdantia

The **Zhodani Consulate** is one of the major powers of Charted Space—and one of the most enigmatic to the Third Imperium and other human civilizations.

Its history begins more than **three thousand years ago**, when a group of _humaniti_ developed a culture deeply influenced by the institutional use and acceptance of **psionics**.

The result was a technocratic and hierarchical society, where **mental governance** and collective harmony became foundational pillars.

### Structure and Government

The Zhodani Consulate is led by the _Driant_, a **psionic nobility**—“_Consuls_” or “_Delegates_”—who form a ruling class both politically and _spiritually_.

These individuals possess training and telepathic abilities that allow them to detect lies, internal tensions, and ideological deviations—granting them leadership perceived as benevolent and efficient by most of their population.

The political system is a **psionic meritocracy**, where social ascent is determined by mental capability and discipline.

The political elite is overseen by a higher council, the _Drianzhentshe_ —**Committee of Consensus**—charged with maintaining mental and social cohesion through psychological adjustment practices and continuous education.

### Society and Culture

Zhodani culture is based on principles of **collective harmony**, **emotional transparency**, and **psychic equilibrium**.

Unlike most human cultures, mental privacy is not considered an absolute right.

On the contrary, emotional clarity and the absence of internal conflict are valued.

Open dissent is rare—not due to violent repression, but because early intervention mechanisms (psionic psychotherapy, educational adjustment, social realignment) act before tensions escalate.

Citizens live in an environment of relative security and well‑being, though from an Imperial perspective, this is often perceived as a form of **benevolent totalitarianism**.

### Foreign Relations

The Consulate maintains a calculated and controlled foreign policy.

Although it engages in diplomatic and commercial relations, its actions are always guided by a **collective strategic interest**, often wrapped in an aura of paternalism or subtle manipulation.

Relations with the Third Imperium are traditionally tense: a mix of mutual respect, ideological rivalry, and a constant cold war.

Psionic espionage, indirect manipulation, and regional influence conflicts are common, though rarely escalating into open conflict.

## Driantia Zhdantia in the Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, the **Zhodani Consulate** is not merely an _Allegiance_: it represents a radically different paradigm of organization, authority, and information.

Zhodani corporations are conscious extensions of their civilization’s mental fabric. Governed by psionic elites, they align synergistically. For their executives, every operation is an expression of mental balance and structural cohesion.

Players adopting this _Allegiance_ access tools that are subtle, efficient—and possibly unsettling.

They perceive the game through angles invisible to others and act with precision grounded not in raw data, but in the internal certainty of _precognition_.

But harmony comes at the cost of transparency. While others conceal, the Zhodani reveal. Sofont perception is volatile in the face of psionic societies’ empirical honesty: some see sincerity, others detect dehumanized pragmatism—or hidden agendas behind a façade of truth.

To other _Allegiances_, the Consulate inspires both fascination and distrust. Alliances are possible, but rarely comfortable for non‑Zhodani; there is always suspicion that even in cooperation, more than a contract is being steered.

Playing a Zhodani corporation means embodying an alien ideal of sophisticated efficiency—where every decision shapes not just the market, but the collective mind of an entire _Allegiance_.
