# Tavrchedl'

The **Tavrchedl'**, often misunderstood by Imperial-aligned cultures as a secret police or psionic inquisition, is in fact an institution of **social harmonization and mental correction** within the Zhodani Consulate.

Its primary role is to maintain ideological coherence, emotional well-being, and collective unity in Zhodani society through psionic methods of evaluation, adjustment, and education.

## Nature and Purpose

The Tavrchedl' is not a police force or intelligence agency in the traditional sense.

It does not act repressively, but rather seeks to restore internal balance in individuals and preserve societal harmony.

Its existence is rooted in a fundamental Zhodani belief: **mental dissonance is a disease, not a crime**.

All its agents are certified telepaths trained under strict ethical protocols and institutional oversight.

Their interventions focus not on punishment, but on psionic diagnosis and treatment of deviant thoughts, destructive emotions, or antisocial attitudes.

## Areas of Operation

The Tavrchedl' intervenes across a wide range of social contexts: from minor cases of collective anxiety to signs of antisocial resentment or violent ideation.

It is also responsible for evaluating citizens seeking public office or diplomatic integration, ensuring their mental stability aligns with consular values.

Its presence spans schools, mental health centers, functional selection agencies, and occasionally worlds under consular influence where harmony is at risk.

It does not operate beyond Zhodani territory except in missions of assistance or evaluation.

## Relationship with the Dazhia

While the Tavrchedl' and the **Driantia Dazhia** operate independently, they share a doctrinal principle: stability is paramount.

In times of social crisis, both entities may coordinate to restore order without resorting to unnecessary violence.

The Tavrchedl' manages the mind; the Dazhia manages the space.

## Tavrchedl' In-Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, the Tavrchedl' represents a subtle form of power — not based on weapons, but on the mind.

Players may encounter its agents in missions involving diplomacy, mediation, or cultural analysis.

Their presence can generate tension among non-Zhodani _Polities_, especially these with secrets or hidden agendas.

Interacting with the Tavrchedl' does not imply direct threat, but it does mean being subjected to mental scrutiny few are prepared to endure.

For the Consulate, emotional transparency is a sign of health.

For outsiders, it may feel like a form of invasion.
