# Driantia Dazhia

The **Driantia Dazhia**, or **Consular Fleet**, is the unified military arm of the Zhodani Consulate.

Unlike other interstellar powers, its structure is not divided into separate branches. The entire military, logistical, and strategic apparatus operates under a single coherent doctrine of institutional control, directly subordinated to the _Driantia_ — the elite psionic council of the Zhodani government.

The Dazhia does not function as a conventional offensive force.

Its mandate is to preserve interstellar harmony, protect key jump routes, ensure the security of consular enclaves, and maintain equilibrium in sensitive zones.

Its deployment is always a manifestation of institutional power and the collective will of the Consulate — never impulsive or arbitrary.

## Command and Composition

Every military operation is led by officers with psionic training, and any significant deployment is authorized and overseen by one or more military _Driants_.

These leaders combine command functions with telepathic abilities, ensuring doctrinal alignment across field units.

The Dazhia includes jump-capable fleets for rapid deployment, tactical intervention detachments, diplomatic protection squadrons, and transit control forces.

Its logistics corps is equipped for autonomous operation in isolated systems, and its presence extends to border regions and high-value trade corridors.

## Doctrine and Operations

The operational doctrine of the Driantia Dazhia emphasizes deterrence, informational superiority, and the rapid neutralization of threats.

Its arsenal and training are designed to prevent conflicts before they escalate, maintaining a balance between visible force and psionic capability.

Direct armed confrontation is always a last resort.

It does not perform civil enforcement, ideological correction, or internal psionic oversight — those are responsibilities of the Tavrchedl’.

However, in emergencies or regional collapses, both organizations may coordinate strategically.

## Role in **The Corporate Wars**

In **The Corporate Wars**, the Driantia Dazhia represents the formal military presence of the Zhodani Consulate.

Its arrival in a system signifies that the area has been declared of institutional interest.

Players may encounter the Dazhia during patrol missions, consular assistance operations, protection of logistical nodes, or interventions in contested zones.

It does not engage in minor skirmishes or respond to local provocations without explicit authorization from the _Driantia_.

Its deployment draws a diplomatic line that is difficult to cross without consequence.

In gameplay terms, encountering Dazhia units does not automatically mean combat — but it does mean facing a force with absolute authority and strategic backing.

Aligning with the Dazhia grants access to interstellar protection and consular support, but it also means operating under the judgment and priorities of a power that values collective harmony over individual autonomy.
