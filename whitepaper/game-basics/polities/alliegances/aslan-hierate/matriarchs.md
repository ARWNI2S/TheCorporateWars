# Ahriy’i

The **Ahriy’i** are the **family matriarchs of Aslan clans**. In a culture where lineage is inherited through the male line but operational leadership falls to women, the Ahriy’i form the functional backbone of each family unit.

There is not a single leader per clan, but rather a distributed network of matriarchs who govern, organize, and ensure the continuity of their family branch. Every significant outpost, ship, or installation carries its own Ahriy’i — a recognized authority with jurisdiction over internal decisions, resource management, and external clan representation.

## Social Role

Ahriy’i do not hold formal authority over the entire clan, but they exercise full control over their immediate family cell. This decentralization allows multiple branches of the same clan to operate simultaneously in different locations, each under its own matriarchal leadership.

Especially among the Iloahktahe clans —often marginalized from the formal Tlaukhu system— Ahriy’i are essential for operational survival. Without an Ahriy’i, an Aslan cell loses cohesion, direction, and legitimacy.

Any installation, vessel, or settlement lacking an active Ahriy’i is seen as incomplete, at risk, or in an exceptional crisis. The death of an Ahriy’i without a female heir marks the functional end of that family cell.

## Ahriy’i in the Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, the Ahriy’i offer a structural advantage to Aslan _Polities_: they don’t need to hire command personnel to operate offworld. Every deployment includes its own built-in, legitimate authority.

This gives Aslan _Polities_ a tactical autonomy that other _Loyalties_ can only match through additional staff, costly training, or complex delegation mechanisms.

Ahriy’i are active characters from the outset. Their presence ensures smooth operations, internal cohesion, and immediate decision-making.

Playing with this structure is not just a matter of efficiency — it’s about embodying the Aslan spirit, where each clan cell carries its own history, its purpose, and its matriarch.
