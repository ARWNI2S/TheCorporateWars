# Iloahktahe

The **Iloahktahe** are the clans without recognized honor within the Aslan Hierate.

This term, heavy with ambiguity and stigma, includes both young houses that have yet to earn social validation, and lineages that have lost their status through dishonor.

It also encompasses individuals cast out from their clans who survive as mercenaries, traders, or founders of new dynasties in the frontier regions.

The Iloahktahe represent a **phase of dissent, exclusion, or aspiration** within the Aslan aristocratic structure—a vital part of the Hierate’s dynamism: the living frontier where honor is lost, redefined, or won.

## Exile as Foundation

For many Iloahktahe, lack of recognition is a challenge—and honor a goal. They operate in **expansion territories**, establish colonies, claim contested systems, and strive to prove—through action—that they deserve integration into the Hierate.

Not all seek return. Some prefer to maintain their cultural autonomy, redefined codes of honor, or unorthodox alliances.

But many Iloahktahe clans see their condition as **a transitional phase**—a test of merit.

If they stabilize holdings, maintain their bloodline, and gain the favor of a recognized clan, they may be embraced, absorbed, or rehabilitated into the Tlaukhu.

That ascent is never permanent. Recognized clans that fall from grace can return to Iloahktahe status. The cycle persists: **honor, fall, ascent, legacy**.

## Iloahktahe in the Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, the Iloahktahe are part of the metagame within the Aslan _Alliegance_, representing _Polities_ in a state of marginalization, ascension, or ideological divergence.

They may take the form of **nomadic fleets, emerging colonies, mercenary houses, hybrid republics, or doctrinal enclaves** seeking recognition from the Tlaukhu. Some even register as **foreign corporations under Imperial law**, operating autonomously while preserving their Aslan heritage.

Playing an Iloahktahe _Polity_ allows players to explore the core Aslan gameplay loop: **conquering territory, founding domains, securing bloodlines, and seeking reintegration into the Hierate**.

Each victory in expansion can yield prestige; each alliance, a chance to rise; each claimed world, an argument for acceptance.

But it also comes with constant risk: **to fail, fragment, or drift too far from accepted values is to fall again into ritual exile**.

Iloahktahe lack recognized tradition—but they can build it. They lack precedence—but can impose it. They lack an accepted past—but may forge a future the Tlaukhu cannot ignore.
