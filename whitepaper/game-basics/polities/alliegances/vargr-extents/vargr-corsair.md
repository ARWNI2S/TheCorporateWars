# Corsair Packs

The **Vargr Corsair Packs** are the most visible —and feared— manifestation of Vargr culture in the interstitial regions of the Extents. They are not mere pirates, but mobile power structures grounded in charismatic hierarchy, ritualized violence, and informal economic control.

A corsair pack might consist of a single flagship with an extended crew, or a whole flotilla operating as a coordinated pack, ruling over routes, enclaves, and loosely held territories.

Some act as mercenaries in the service of larger powers. Others extort, trade, and offer protection to communities under their sway, establishing systems of —voluntary tribute— in exchange for asymmetric security.

Their legitimacy rests on the leader�s **charisma**: the ability to inspire, command, and maintain success. Lose it, and the clan fractures or is absorbed by rivals. It's a Darwinian dynamic —but one that works.

## Corsair Packs in the Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, corsair packs are both threat and opportunity.

They appear as **intermediary forces**, capable of tipping conflicts, sealing routes, or establishing mobile fiefdoms where the law of the strongest —or the cleverest— prevails.

Playable _Polities_ may ally with them, subcontract them, or challenge them, but they can never ignore them. An operation near their influence without prior consent may be considered provocation.

Some Vargr _Polities_ are corsair packs themselves: autonomous fleets with their own codes, collecting tribute, running black markets, and vying for prestige among rivals.

In their domains, there are no contracts —only **submission or tolerance**. Challenge them without sufficient charisma, and you lose.

To play with —or against— corsair packs is to accept that order is a temporary illusion, upheld by reputation, strategic violence, and the audacity of a leader.

Nothing is permanent. Everything is negotiable. Everyone is watching.
