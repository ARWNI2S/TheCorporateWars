# The Vargr Extents

The **Vargr Extents** are not a state, a federation, or even a defined bloc with recognized borders. They form a dynamic (_dis_)continuum of clans, domains, nomadic packs, stellar nations, and influence networks governed by the **vargr** species.

At the heart of their civilization lies no legal code, but **charisma**: a force of personal authority blending prestige, cunning, victory, presence, and recognition.

Each vargr community organizes itself around those who radiate such charisma —and disbands when it fades. This makes the Extents a fluid, unpredictable, chaotic, and profoundly vibrant space.

There is no single voice, no singular flag. There are trends, rumors, floating clans, black market networks, and fleeting hegemonies.

Some regions maintain stable relations with the Imperium and the Consulate —or a stable hostility with the Two Thousand Worlds— while others shift allegiances each cycle.

Vargr diplomacy isn't based on lasting treaties, but on the momentum of the moment and the leader's prestige.

By 1201, many zones within the Extents are becoming more professionalized: mobile corporations, security protocols, foreign missions. Yet even these structures are subject to the ebb and flow of charisma and collective assent. Nothing is permanent. Everything is in play.

## The Vargr Extents in the Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, the Extents represent a decentralized, mobile form of power —perfect for players who seek freedom, adaptability, and personal dominance.

Vargr _Polities_ may take the form of nomadic clans, corsair fleets, family-run firms, smuggling networks, orbital micronations, or opportunistic alliances.

Their power hinges on the reputation of their leaders, their ability to negotiate, and their skill in adapting to instability.

Playing under this _Allegiance_ grants access to illegal routes, unique opportunities, and high-stakes tactical partnerships. But it also means living on the edge of collapse or betrayal. What is an ally today may challenge you tomorrow for leadership, influence, or loot.

There are no institutions to back you —only your charisma. No structure to shield you —only your skill. No legacy to justify you —only your present.

Being vargr isn't about having a lineage: it's about **earning it every day**.
