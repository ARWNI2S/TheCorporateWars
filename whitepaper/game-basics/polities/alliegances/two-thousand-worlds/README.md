# The Two Thousand Worlds

The **Concordance of the Two Thousand Worlds** is the civilizational bloc dominated by the **k’Kree** species—a profoundly herbivorous, collective, and militant culture whose political system is structured as an expansionist theocracy with radical ecological foundations.

Despite its name, the Concordance encompasses far more than two thousand planets. The number is symbolic: it represents the original vision of a predator-free galactic order, where all worlds have been purified of carnivorous species and their derivatives.

The k’Kree are xenophobic, but not impulsively genocidal. Their doctrine demands not indiscriminate extermination, but re-education, conversion, and large-scale terraforming. However, their intolerance toward carnivorous—and even omnivorous—cultures makes them a high-risk diplomatic force.

Internally, the Concordance operates as a hierarchical network of clans, guided by a Council of Visionary Elders. Their decisions blend religious doctrine, ecological analysis, and strategic objectives. They reject psionics, but wield a logistics system of extreme precision.

As of the year 1201, the Concordance maintains a tense balance with its neighbors. Though their “purification” campaigns have slowed, their doctrine remains unchanged: the universe must be cleansed. What has changed is their method—now operating through transactional alliances, ideological pressure, and aggressive yet formally legitimate diplomacy.

## The Two Thousand Worlds in the Game

In **The Corporate Wars**, the Concordance is not a bargaining _Allegiance_: it is a doctrinal force with its own agenda.

Playable k’Kree _Polities_ are not founded on planets, but on migratory herds and ecological fleets built for biological terraforming. Their bases of operation are orbital vessels, landing platforms, or mobile habitats aligned with sacred principles.

Their narratives revolve around **doctrinal expansion**, ecological transformation, and the imposition of bioethical norms wherever they arrive. They do not trade—they reform. They do not negotiate—they correct.

Their alliances are rare but possible, when serving their long-term goals. Dealing with them requires strict adaptation: dietary purges, ideological commitments, biosphere redesigns.

For players, engaging with—or against—the k’Kree means facing a logic that is alien, impersonal, and absolute. They do not seek power, but purity. They do not pursue wealth, but total ecological harmony.

Successful _Polities_ under this _Allegiance_ don’t adapt to the system—they redefine it.
