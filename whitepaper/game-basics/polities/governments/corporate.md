# Corporate Government

Among the various forms of government in Known Space, the **Corporate Government** stands out, where administration and political power are directly held by a corporation or business consortium.

In this model, the board of directors or shareholders replace traditional governing bodies, and decisions are made based on logic of profit and commercial expansion.

**Corporate Governments** manage colonies and worlds as extensions of their assets, regulating the lives of their inhabitants under internal regulations where citizenship and property are subordinated to corporate interests.

For players, a **Corporate Government** represents a political organization they can confront, integrate with, or even directly embody.

Interacting with these entities means operating within a rigid institutional framework, where every action is regulated, and access to resources or privileges depends on adherence to internal regulations and contractual agreements.

Those who control these governments must manage both their assets and political responsibilities, balancing operational efficiency with territorial control and institutional legitimacy.
