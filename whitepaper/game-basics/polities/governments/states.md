# Balkanizations

**Balkanizations** describe worlds or regions where no unified government exists, but rather multiple independent political or cultural authorities share the same space.

These divisions may arise from history, culture, or convenience, and are common in both pre-stellar civilizations and contested colonies.

Although politically fragmented, these societies may share genetic, cultural, economic, or defensive ties and act in a coordinated manner in response to threats or common interests.

This is not chaos, but rather parallel structures that coexist, negotiate, and occasionally collaborate when the situation demands it.

***

Corporations find both opportunities and obstacles in these environments.

Every deal must be negotiated separately, each territory may open or close its doors independently, and alliances must be cultivated with care.

For players, operating in a balkanized world means navigating a complex terrain where diplomacy, economics, and force intertwine with surgical precision.
