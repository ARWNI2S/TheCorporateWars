# Governments

In **The Corporate Wars**, governments represent _Polities_ with sovereign authority over territories, populations, and resources.

Their structure and scope vary from small regional states to interplanetary governments that encompass entire star systems.

Each exercises its power through legal systems, armed forces, and bureaucracies dedicated to maintaining order and managing their domains.

***

### Types of Government

The diversity of government forms reflects the historical and cultural circumstances of each world or coalition, from inherited monarchies to functional republics or military dictatorships.

These political and cultural differences directly impact trade and foreign relations.

Some governments promote open markets, applying low tariffs and encouraging the free movement of goods and capital, while others shield themselves behind strict customs regulations and state monopolies.

In certain worlds, the law is flexible and favorable to foreign investment; in others, xenophobia or cultural isolation makes any dealings with outsiders difficult.

These conditions define the risks and opportunities of operating within each jurisdiction and turn navigating Known Space into a constant game of diplomacy, adaptation, and strategy.

***

Corporations play a fundamental role in this equation.

Many have acquired legal rights allowing them to operate as de facto states in territories under their control, enforcing their own rules and regulations within their facilities, fleets, and colonies.

In some cases, galactic powers delegate the administration of entire systems to them, making them key actors in managing trade, security, and interstellar diplomacy.
