# Corporations

In a setting where instantaneous communication is not viable, corporations represent the core of economic activity, interstellar expansion, and planetary resource management.

They serve both as engines of development and instruments of influence, used by _Polities_ and _Allegiances_ to shape the balance of power across the galaxy.

Corporations have the power to define the galaxy’s future—whether through cooperation, ruthless competition, or strategic market manipulation.

Success lies in a combination of business vision, aggressive tactics, and adaptability in an ever-changing universe.

## Universal Corporate Profile

Corporate profiles are dehydrated data stored directly on the Solana network as minimalist PDAs representing active corporations in the game.

These data are used for resolving the **strategic turn**, and as variables for governance, compliance, and traceability within the game ecosystem.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This module is still under active development, and the descriptions provided below are temporary.\
—They have been directly imported from [101 Corporations](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/121552/101-corporations) as examples.
