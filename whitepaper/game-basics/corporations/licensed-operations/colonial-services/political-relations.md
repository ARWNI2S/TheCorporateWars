# Government Relations

Corporations must establish solid, legal, and operational ties with planetary governments�the actors who define rules, regulate trade, and grant concessions.

Each planetary government has its own structure, ideology, needs, and constraints.

A corporation might find favorable conditions in a technocracy open to investment while facing restrictions or scrutiny under an autarkic regime or in worlds with a strong military presence.

Negotiating access, taxes, permits, and operational zones is part of the game.

Sometimes, a good public image helps build these relationships.

But other times, there may be a strategic dissonance: a corporation popular among the population may be seen as a threat by the local government —especially if its actions challenge the established order or attract influence from rival _Allegiances_.

The opposite can also occur: governments quietly favoring certain corporations aligned with their interests, even if these lack public support.

The ability to navigate these scenarios —through diplomacy, bribery, legal pressure, or strategic alliances— determines access to key opportunities: public service contracts, infrastructure grants, industrial zones, or even support in local conflicts.
