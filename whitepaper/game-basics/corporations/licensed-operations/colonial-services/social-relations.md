# Public Image

A corporation's public image is not just a matter of public relations: it is a strategic tool that can define its political influence, its access to new contracts, and its acceptance by governments and local populations.

In the colonial context, where the ties between _Allegiances_, planetary governments, and corporate actors are complex and shifting, reputation becomes a negotiable asset.

A corporation perceived as responsible, efficient, and respectful of local communities may obtain exclusive grants, priority in bids, and institutional support during crises.

Likewise, a strong image projected at the interstellar level can provide access to restricted zones, improve positioning in multilateral treaties, or even block competitors through indirect diplomatic pressure.

***

> Crisis management, investment in public services, social programs, regulatory compliance, and media presence are some of the mechanisms used to build —or restore— public image.

{% hint style="danger" %}
A corporation that neglects this aspect is exposed to boycotts, license revocations, public protests, or sabotage driven by hostile _Polities_.
