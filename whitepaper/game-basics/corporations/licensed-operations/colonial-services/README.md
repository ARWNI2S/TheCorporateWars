# Colonial Services

_Developing worlds_, newly contacted systems, and emerging colonies require infrastructure and essential services to operate efficiently.

_Worlds with extreme climates_, exotic atmospheres, or limited resources depend on technological imports, deployment, management, maintenance, and administration of multiple services to ensure the survival of the colony.

In _developed worlds_ of Known Space, governments have extensively practiced service outsourcing since pre-stellar eras.

These services include power supply, waste management, potable water distribution, life support, communications, and logistics, among many other specific needs.

***

Corporations provide these services to independent colonial communities that prefer to focus on their core activities —such as agriculture, industry, or mining— without taking on the burden of administrative and operational management.

Corporations operating in this sector act as support providers for settlements, relying on the interstellar market to ensure colonies can focus on their activities without worrying about structural necessities.

Controlling these services allows corporations to establish dependency relationships with colonies, gaining long-term profits and a strategic position within planetary politics.
