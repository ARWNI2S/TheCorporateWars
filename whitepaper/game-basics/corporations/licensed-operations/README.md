# Licensed Operations

In **The Corporate Wars**, corporations operate under the watchful eye of interstellar authorities, which regulate their activities through licenses, permits, tariffs, and taxes.

From the moment of their founding, each corporation receives an _operational license_ for certain basic operations, issued by the affiliated _Allegiance_ or by one of the institutional _Polities_ that compose it.

_Operational licenses_ carry fiscal compliance requirements: taxes on activities and profits. Strategic or restricted activities require passing additional filters.

These regulations not only impose limits, but also reflect the interests of the _Polities_ that enforce them.

***

Obtaining permits, licenses, and concessions —and negotiating them— can become as challenging as it is profitable.

Key sectors such as resource exploitation, private security, and financial manipulation are subject to strict regulations, designed to restrict access and maintain control.

While some corporations meticulously comply with every requirement, others find creative ways to fast-track procedures or tilt the balance in their favor.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When registering a new corporation, players must decide the scope and extent of their operation, keeping in mind that each license carries specific costs and requirements, exponentially increasing the initial difficulty and the complexity of corporate management within the game.
