# Manufacturing

Manufacturing is the process by which raw materials are transformed into finished products, ranging from consumer goods to industrial equipment and starships.

It is a central activity for the economic development of any corporation, as it enables production scaling, revenue generation, and the strengthening of internal infrastructure.

Corporations build and optimize factories, assembly lines, and distribution centers.

They must efficiently manage the production chain, ensuring a constant flow of resources from extraction sites to final product delivery.

Factors such as automation, specialization, and logistics play a key role in the competitiveness of a manufacturing corporation.

Those able to establish efficient and well-integrated production can dominate entire markets, influence the interstellar economy, and consolidate their position as key players in **The Corporate Wars**.

{% hint style="success" %}
Corporations entering the manufacturing sector must balance supply with product demand to succeed. This is a good choice for players who prefer to generate technology as a source of income rather than depend on it in the long term.
