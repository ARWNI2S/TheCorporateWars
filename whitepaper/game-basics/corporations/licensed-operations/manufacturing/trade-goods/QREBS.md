# QREBS

The **Quality, Reliability, Ease of Use, Burden, and Safety** (QREBS) system is a standardized model for product evaluation and classification widely adopted by the Interstellar Community.

Beyond technological level, QREBS measures the real user experience of a product: how long it lasts, how easy it is to use, whether it generates waste or logistical issues, and how safe it is for operators or users.

These factors affect not only quality of life and working conditions but also operational efficiency, maintenance costs, and the public perception of a brand.

***

From an orbital station coffeemaker to a jump-cruise navigation system, every component can be optimized according to QREBS criteria—and that optimization has systemic consequences: less material wear, better performance, higher customer satisfaction, and most importantly, more valuable patents.

> In **The Corporate Wars**, improving a product’s QREBS score can make the difference between a functional item and an indispensable one.

{% hint style="success" %}
Corporations that master this metric don’t just sell more—they define standards, accumulate production licenses, and in many cases, impose their technological culture on entire worlds.
{% endhint %}

> The QREBS system used in **The Corporate Wars** is directly inspired by the original framework introduced in _Traveller™ 5_. While it employs different mechanics, it remains grounded in the same fundamental principles.
