# Trade Goods

The production of trade goods is directly determined by the available technology level: each product requires infrastructure, a degree of expertise, and materials compatible with its Tech Level—making technology both a limiting and differentiating factor.

A low-tech world may assemble simple tools but will never replicate interstellar navigation components or advanced medical devices.

The distribution of high-Tech Level trade goods becomes a strategic advantage: those who can produce or import what others cannot manufacture set the rules of the market.

***

> Operating at this scale requires technical knowledge, access to refined materials, and compliance with interplanetary regulations.

In **The Corporate Wars**, trade goods are not just about technology: their quality, reliability, cultural adaptability, or specific design for different _sophonts_ also determines their real market value.
