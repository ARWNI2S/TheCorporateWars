# Raw Materials

Every manufacturing operation depends on a stable supply of raw materials: from rare metals to organic compounds, including industrial gases and synthetic elements —materials are the essential input of every productive economy.

***

In well-developed environments, having a local source reduces logistical costs and ensures supply continuity.

But in specialized or high-tech regions, importing from distant worlds can be more profitable, even with the risks associated with interstellar transport.

> Dominating this sector requires efficiency in refining, foresight in supply chains, and the ability to respond to shortages, trade blockades, or shifts in galactic demand.

A corporation that controls materials controls the pace of production —and with it, the opportunities of an entire region.
