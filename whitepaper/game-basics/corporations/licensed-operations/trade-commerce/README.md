# Trade and Commerce

Interstellar trade connects economies, cultures, and corporate strategies, defining which worlds thrive, which routes consolidate, and which regions are left behind in development.

Specialized corporations operate trade networks, dealing in common, exotic, or strategic goods.

Markets shift with politics, conflicts, and local agreements; they demand tactical vision, adaptability, and a constant balance between risk and reward.

The trade of consumer goods —whether essential or simply desired by the local population— can enhance a corporation's public image; however, unpopular decisions or exploitative practices may have the opposite effect.

That's why trade doesn't just move MCr: it exerts influence, opens societies, and reshapes cultural borders —without firing a single shot.
