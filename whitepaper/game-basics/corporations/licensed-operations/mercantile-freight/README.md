# Freight Transport

Freight transport is the backbone of the interstellar economy: the ability to move goods, supplies, and people efficiently defines the success of any _Polity_.

Specialized corporations are responsible for connecting markets, distributing manufactured products, and keeping key communication routes operational by managing fleets of freighters, exchange stations, and logistical networks.

Corporations must optimize their transport routes, ensure convoy protection, and establish trade agreements with clients and strategic partners.

A well-managed transport infrastructure not only enables the efficient flow of goods but can also be used to monopolize markets, control prices, and exert influence over emerging economies.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Operating in interstellar freight is the most direct way to engage with the high-level economy: risky investments, often made blindly.
