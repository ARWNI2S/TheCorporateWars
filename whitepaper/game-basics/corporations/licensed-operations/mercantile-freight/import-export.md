# Import-Export

No planetary economy, no matter how self-sufficient it may seem, is free from external flows:

* **Importing** ensures access to advanced technologies, scarce raw materials, or high-demand cultural goods.
* **Exporting** allows local production to enter wider networks, gaining foreign currency, prestige, or influence.

A corporation operating in this field must understand not only logistics, but also the economic policies of each world: tariffs, quotas, subsidies, phytosanitary regulations, technological preferences, or cultural restrictions.

> Importing a medication may require consular approval; exporting an alloy may be subject to interplanetary treaties or clashing _Allegiances_.

Moreover, local markets are sensitive: a massive import can destroy a domestic producer; a prioritized export may lead to critical shortages.

Knowing when to move, how much, and at what price is just as important as having access to the cargo.

In **The Corporate Wars**, importing or exporting is not just moving goods: it's actively intervening in a world's economic metabolism â€”and either suffering or capitalizing on the consequences.
