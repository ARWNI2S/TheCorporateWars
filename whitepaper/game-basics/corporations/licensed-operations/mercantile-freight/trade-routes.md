# Route Brokers

**Route brokers** are specialized operators in the interplanetary movement of goods. Their role is to manage shipments between systems, coordinating transport, routes, cargo, and delivery under shifting conditions.

In **The Corporate Wars**, these services may be integrated within a corporation, outsourced to third parties, or provided by independent networks like the ISE, the SPA, or even by other logistics corporations.

Their job is to assign cargo to available ships, select safe and profitable routes, coordinate ports, deadlines, permits, and negotiate rates with carriers and authorities.

> They are a vital part of the logistical ecosystem: keeping the flow of goods moving with agility, adaptability, and economic sense.

{% hint style="success" %}
A corporation with access to good brokers reduces risk, optimizes profits, and strengthens its responsiveness in a dynamic and competitive market.
