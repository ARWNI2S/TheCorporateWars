# COACC

The Close Orbit and Aerospace Command Control (COACC) is a strategic function in advanced planetary administration, ensuring the security of the near-space environment around inhabited worlds.

It encompasses the monitoring and regulation of low orbit traffic, atmospheric approaches, ascent and reentry routes, as well as the control of space platforms, orbital stations, and militarized zones near the atmosphere.

In many worlds, this function is carried out directly by local authorities or planetary government military branches.

However, it's not uncommon for its execution to be delegated to specialized corporations or interplanetary consortia through security contracts or operational licenses.

***

Effective COACC management requires both technical capability —orbital sensors, traffic protocols, interception armament— and political legitimacy, as decisions regarding transit, access, or exclusion affect diplomatic and commercial interests.

> A corporation operating in this field must strike a delicate balance: exercising authority without sparking tensions, ensuring security without obstructing economic flow, and defending without unnecessarily escalating conflicts.

{% hint style="success" %}
Operating the COACC can elevate a corporation to a key player within a system, with the ability to protect, block, or condition access to strategic resources.
