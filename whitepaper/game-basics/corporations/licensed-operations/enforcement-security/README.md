# Enforcement and Security

Ensuring safety in settlements, trade routes, and strategic assets requires constant investment in technology, training, and personnel deployment.

Corporations specialized in Police and Security relieve this burden for governments, colonies, and other corporations by offering comprehensive solutions for asset protection and operational stability.

These corporations provide trained personnel, tactical equipment, surveillance systems, defense protocols, and risk management strategies.

***

This activity translates into the construction and maintenance of security infrastructure, optimization of protection unit deployment, and management of resources allocated to defense.

A well-managed security corporation can not only safeguard its own and third-party assets but also establish a monopoly on planetary protection, turning security into a profitable and strategically critical industry.

***

{% hint style="danger" %}
Operating in the police and security sector involves very high financial risks, including the destruction of property and personnel.\
This market is suitable for patient players with long-term goals who can minimize risk while engaging in third-party conflicts.
