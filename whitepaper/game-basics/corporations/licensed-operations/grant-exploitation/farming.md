# Farming and Livestock

Agricultural production on colonized worlds forms the foundation of population sustenance and is a strategic component of regional stability.

Unlike mining, these operations require either harmony with the local ecosystem or its complete transformation, depending on the degree of terraforming or technological adaptation available.

Extreme climates, marginal soils, or incompatible biotas are common obstacles—but also challenges that drive genetic innovation, closed-loop farming techniques, or food replication solutions.

***

A corporation licensed to operate in this sector gains direct access to essential goods: food, water, fibers, and derived products.

Interplanetary-scale agriculture not only supplies colonies—it creates dependency routes, shapes populations, and builds political ties.

> An agricultural world can become a strategic asset if it guarantees supply to key stations or isolated sectors.

Success in this sector depends as much on productivity as on the ability to maintain stable relationships with governments, settler unions, and logistics networks.
