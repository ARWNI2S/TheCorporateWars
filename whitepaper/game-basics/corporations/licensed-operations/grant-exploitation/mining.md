# Ore Mining

The **ore mining** industry is one of the most direct ways to extract wealth in the interplanetary environment, and one of the most widespread corporate activities across Known Space.

From asteroid belts to icy moons, from orbital platforms to tunnels carved beneath the crust of marginal worlds, mining supports industries, trade routes, and conflicts over control of strategic resources.

***

A corporation licensed for this activity must not only identify profitable deposits but also establish permanent or mobile infrastructures, maintain security in hostile environments, and comply with local, environmental, and labor regulations that vary between jurisdictions.

Mass extraction can cause friction with local populations, property disputes, or tensions with other corporations. However, it also opens opportunities for alliances with governments, exclusive contracts, and access to processing or refining technologies.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Mining is not a stand-alone operation: it is the first link in many value chains, and its control can mean the difference between dependence and economic sovereignty across an entire subsector.
