# Grant Exploitation

Access to natural resources is a fundamental pillar in the expansion and development of any society.

_Grants_ regulate exclusive rights over fertile planetary surface regions, rich in minerals, energy sources, or strategic materials.

Without these resources, manufacturing, infrastructure, and interstellar expansion would be unsustainable.

***

Corporations operating in this sector must manage the prospecting, extraction, transport, and processing of raw materials, ensuring a constant flow of inputs to the market.

This requires the construction and optimization of mining facilities, refineries, and distribution networks, as well as the management of logistical and security costs in the face of possible external incursions.

Controlling a key _grant_ can give a corporation formidable economic power, allowing it to negotiate from a position of strength or even establish monopolies over certain essential materials.
