# Facilities

Facilities include factories, refineries, space stations, logistics hubs, starports, and research laboratories; they are the operational core of every corporation.

Each type of facility plays a specific role within the corporation's operational chainâ€”whether in manufacturing, resource exploitation, trade, or defense.

Their location and efficiency determine the company's productive capacity and ability to expand, and their development requires investment in infrastructure, security, and technology.

Proper management allows for scaling production, optimizing costs, and improving responsiveness to market opportunities or threats.
