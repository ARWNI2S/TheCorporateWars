# Equipment Improvements

Corporate facilities operate through a complex ecosystem of machinery, specialized tools, and technical support systems.

This setup determines their production capacity, degree of autonomy, and overall efficiency.

***

Basic equipment enables standard operations, but to excel in a competitive sector, corporations must invest in upgrades: automation, advanced energy systems, optimized assembly lines, or tools tailored to local resources.

Beyond boosting productivity, improvements can reduce material wear, minimize human error, or enable work in extreme environments.

***

Not all upgrades are available on every world: access depends on local tech levels, trade relations, and interplanetary logistics.

> Upgrading equipment is not an isolated decision, but part of an industrial strategy that aligns with each corporation's long-term planning.
