# Orbital Facilities

Orbital facilities are strategic platforms located in planetary orbit or along stellar transit points.

From cargo stations and logistics hubs to shipyards and high-tech laboratories, they play a fundamental role in advanced corporate infrastructure.

Unlike planetary installations, orbital structures enable faster, safer, and more specialized operations.

They can manage cargo transit without relying on the surface, facilitate launches and landings, serve as telecommunications nodes, or function as bases for security and exploration operations.

Their construction and maintenance require significant investment and legal authorization, often subject to regulations from local governments or _Allegiances_.
