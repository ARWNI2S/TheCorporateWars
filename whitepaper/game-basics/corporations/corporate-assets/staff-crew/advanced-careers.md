# Advanced Careers

Some characters are individuals with a unique background, uncommon training, or experience in high-impact roles that go beyond conventional professional careers.

Veteran captains, imperial spies, double agents, repentant corsairs, disgraced nobles, or executives with a military past — all represent exceptional profiles, difficult to recruit but with disruptive potential.

***

Advanced careers offer tactical, diplomatic, or logistical advantages that can shift the course of an operation or significantly reinforce a corporate division.

However, they also carry complex pasts, ambiguous loyalties, and inherent risks.

Integrating them requires balance, oversight, and the ability to manage personalities as valuable as they are unpredictable.
