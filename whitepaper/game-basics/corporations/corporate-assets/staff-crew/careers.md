# Character Careers

Some individuals stand out beyond regular personnel: they are characters with history, background, and well-defined abilities.

These specific corporate assets come from professional careers recognized by institutions aligned with a particular _Allegiance_.

Each professional career —military, technical, scientific, executive, medical, or specialized— provides a set of skills, contact networks, and personal traits that make them key assets for sensitive or strategic operations.

***

Recruiting a character with experience in a given career not only improves performance in their area of expertise, but may also unlock new tactical, contractual, or development options within the game.

Their origin, training, and ideological alignment can be either an asset or a liability, depending on the political environment and the corporation’s _Allegiance_.
