# Grants and Shares

Grants and licenses represent exclusive rights granted by regulatory entities or governments, allowing corporations to exploit resources, operate in strategic sectors, or establish facilities in key locations. Obtaining and maintaining these permits is essential to access new economic opportunities and avoid regulatory sanctions.

Corporations can acquire these rights through negotiations, bidding, or polítical influence, and controlling them can determine a company’s success or failure in fiercely competitive sectors. The management of grants is a strategic tool, as it allows corporations to block rivals and secure exclusive access to specific markets.
