# Grants and Shares

Grants and shares represent exclusive rights granted by regulatory authorities or political entities, allowing corporations to extract resources, operate in strategic sectors, or establish facilities in key locations.

Obtaining and maintaining these rights is essential for accessing economic opportunities and avoiding regulatory penalties.

Corporations may acquire them through negotiations, tenders, or political influence. Their control often determines the success or failure of a company operating in highly competitive sectors.

{% hint style="success" %}
Managing grants is a strategic tool: it allows corporations to block rivals and secure exclusive access to specific markets.
