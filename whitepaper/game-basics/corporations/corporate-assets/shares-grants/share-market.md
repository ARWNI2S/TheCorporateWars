# Stock Market

Corporate shares are tools for investment, speculation, and control. They represent partial ownership and indirect participation —either accountable or anonymous— in corporate activities.

In **The Corporate Wars**, corporations can issue, trade, and buy back shares on local or interstellar markets.

The value of these shares fluctuates based on the corporation's performance, reputation, and strategic decisions.

Acquiring shares in other corporations allows players to influence their direction, gain access to privileged information, or even sabotage them from within.

For the player, operating in the stock market is both a financial opportunity and a way to expand their power network.

But it also carries risk: losing majority control can mean losing leadership over your own corporation.

Some worlds offer regulated markets, while others host opaque environments where less traceable capital flows.

Choosing where and how to play with capital can make the difference between sustained growth and financial collapse.
