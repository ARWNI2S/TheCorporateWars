# Land Grants

Land grants are legal assignments that give a corporation exclusive exploitation rights over a defined portion of planetary surface.

These grants may come from local governments, institutions, _Allegiances_, or private agreements, and are essential for establishing industrial, agricultural, extractive, or strategic operations.

Controlling land goes beyond occupying it: it involves developing, defending, and maintaining its productivity while complying with applicable regulations.

Some areas may offer valuable resources; others, a key position for trade or access to labor-ready populations.

Political stability, pressure from rival corporations, and changing conditions make every land grant a potentially contested asset.
