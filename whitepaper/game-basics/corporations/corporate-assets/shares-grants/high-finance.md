# High Finance

Major investments represent high-cost, high-impact strategic bets.

These are projects that mobilize megacredits, require years of planning, and rely on scarce resources: megastructures, cutting-edge technological developments, partial terraforming, cross-sector alliances, or the acquisition of critical assets.

Launching such operations demands not only capital, but also political influence, sensitive information, and logistical capability.

These investments are often tied to major contracts with governments, _Allegiances_, or consortia, and their success can significantly shift the economic balance of an entire region.

From a gameplay perspective, they are opportunities to convert _Resource Units_ and megacredits into systemic advantages, unlocking new capabilities, structural modifiers, or key diplomatic relationships.
