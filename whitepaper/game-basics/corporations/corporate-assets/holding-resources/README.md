# Resources and Holdings

The resources and properties controlled by a corporation represent its tangible wealth and its ability to generate income. These assets include raw material reserves, transport fleets, industrial complexes, and territories acquired through grants.

Controlling large volumes of resources allows a corporation to sustain production, negotiate from a position of strength, and establish monopolies over key materials essential to the interstellar economy. Efficient management of these assets is crucial to avoid losses due to obsolescence, speculation, or conflicts with other market players.
