# Efficient Management

Efficient management means maintaining a dynamic balance between production, logistics, personnel, and the regulatory environment.

> A corporation is defined by the way it manages its assets.

Optimizing resources means lowering costs, anticipating operational needs, and adapting to market fluctuations or local policies.

Mistakes in station maintenance, staff assignment, or license payments can create bottlenecks that are hard to fix.

The conditions of each world —from taxes to support infrastructure— directly affect operational efficiency.

A good administrator must read these factors and constantly adjust their operational model.
