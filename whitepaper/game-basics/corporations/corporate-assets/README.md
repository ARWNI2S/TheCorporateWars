# Corporate Assets

A corporation’s assets are the foundation upon which its economic, commercial, and military strategies are built. Proper management is key to long-term sustainability and growth.

Corporations operate across various market sectors, each requiring specific assets to function: facilities, vehicles and machinery, owned resources, warehouses and energy access, licenses, concessions, liquidity—and, of course, skilled labor and specialized personnel.

***

The range of available assets is vast, and it is up to the players to define acquisition, maintenance, financing, and deployment strategies for their corporation’s holdings.

> Overacquisition of assets can drain short-term capital, while operating without sufficient reserves can cause problems during periods of scarcity.

{% hint style="info" %}
All corporations are assigned an initial package of core assets, essential for operations.\
Players can acquire additional assets through the in-game market or contribute MCr tokens from their wallets. [Read more...](../../../technologies/solana-network/sustainable-economy/game-marketplace.md)
