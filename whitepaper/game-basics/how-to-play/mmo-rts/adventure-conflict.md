# Adventure and Conflict

Throughout the narrative cycles, the system deploys multiple content-generation mechanisms: from emergent missions to direct assignments from institutional entities, and plots that escalate autonomously; even player-run corporations may issue contracts, specific tasks, or intervention requests.

From publicly sponsored events to covert operations, tactical clashes, or unauthorized interventions, every rumor followed or contact made in a starport can become —literally— a portal to adventure.

Players risk losing crews —or entire fleets— in exchange for great, yet uncertain, rewards.

Failure is not without consequences: the reputation of a corporation that fails its assignments can be severely damaged, especially if the task comes from a high-level patron. The higher the prestige, the greater the reward —but also the greater the risk.

> Military officers, nobles, politicians, and criminal organizations: none take kindly to indiscretion, repeated failure, or direct opposition to their interests.

Every player action has a dual impact: it affects both internal management and corporate relations  —_Allegiances_, _Institutions_, alliances— and the natural adversaries of those _Policies_.

A corporation aligned with the Third Imperium may operate with advantages in its territory... but will face bans, sanctions, and scrutiny in Solomani space. The Two Thousand Worlds are prohibited from operating in the Federation, yet a myriad of independent traders deal with both sides...

Taking sides in an interstellar conflict can be catastrophic for a corporation —especially if it backs the wrong one.

Space or ground battles carry heavy costs in lives, weapons, and munitions; deployment logistics consume large-scale resources. Sometimes even victory isn't profitable, and the wise choice is to de-escalate.

Success, however, brings promotion, fame, and wealth —along with new adversaries and resentful enemies.

Few civilizations possess a holistic memory: the societies of the worlds quickly lose the context of past events, news fades into the background noise of daily life, and in the end, everything —successes and failures alike— is forgotten.
