# MMORTS



### Informational Fog —_Infog of War_

In **The Corporate Wars**, players have a partial and outdated view of the game: only _licensed_ operational _facilities_, or those with appropriately assigned _personnel_, have access to real-time local information and the ability to issue orders.

All other _facilities_—whether owned or foreign—appear outdated due to communication latency, with only the "version" from the last available update being visible.

The frequency of these updates depends on the traffic along interstellar routes between the observer's world and the observed world.

> Nearby worlds with little direct traffic rely on indirect routes—used more frequently—for informational updates, optimizing latency at the cost of increased data staleness.

Likewise, orders travel in the opposite direction: _licensed_ _facilities_ or assigned _personnel_ can issue orders locally in real time; otherwise, any instruction must be generated locally and sent through the same logistical network, with the same resulting delay.

### Narrative Cycles

The game unfolds through narrative cycles that reflect corporate performance: establishment, expansion, contraction, and bankruptcy or bailout, among others.

The length of these narrative cycles is variable and depends on the actual performance of corporate assets in the game. The order in which they appear depends on the current state of the corporation.

During the course of these cycles, the player must adjust their strategies, guided by narrative events, with the goal of optimizing corporate performance: meeting deadlines, fulfilling contracts, handling taxation, and generating profit—progressing toward the next logical narrative stage.

**The Corporate Wars** does not require constant presence or prolonged sessions to progress.

Players can participate actively with brief sessions, focusing on critical decisions, adjusting operations, or responding to key events: what matters is not the number of actions taken, but their strategic quality within the universe’s temporal framework.

### The Simulated Turn

Although **The Corporate Wars** runs in real time, the system uses an internal turn structure to organize simulation processes and maintain coherence.

The base scale is the so-called **strategic turn**, which corresponds to one week of simulation.

This rhythm sets the pace for the entire universe and determines, among other things, economic development, political changes, and the cumulative effects on the broader scenario.

Within each strategic turn, multiple **tactical turns** unfold, depending on the level of activity and observation in each area or situation.

In zones with direct player interaction, recent activity, or intensive surveillance, the simulation increases in resolution to include shorter and more precise cycles: production, labor shifts, construction, weather, ecological dynamics, or even combat are represented through fine-grained temporal processes, executed in real time.

Conversely, low-supervision regions are processed through broader internal turns, with lower temporal resolution, using synthetic models and generalized behaviors.

In this way, the world continues to evolve continuously, but the level of detail adapts to the attention it receives, the narrative context, and the strategic relevance of each zone.

Corporations adapt or collapse, prices fluctuate, political balances shift, and new challenges arise—even in the absence of direct intervention.
