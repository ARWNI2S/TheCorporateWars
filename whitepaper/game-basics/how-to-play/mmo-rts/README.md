# MMORTS

In its strategic layer, **The Corporate Wars** presents itself as a real-time multiplayer game where each corporation competes, collaborates, or clashes with others in a living universe.

Decisions are not merely individual maneuvers: they alter trade routes, transform neutral zones into contested territories, and can trigger galaxy-scale events.

This shared environment forces players to think not only in terms of economic growth, but also in how that growth affects the overall balance of the sector.

***

Each corporation operates through a network of facilities, agents, and contracts, managed via a strategic interface through which the player makes decisions, executes operations, and oversees expansion.

The ability to act is neither universal nor constant: it depends on effective presence, the types of licenses obtained, and access to functional communication channels.

Every action must be performed within the constraints of the simulated universe: limited access, partial information, and asynchronous resolution.

### The Simulated Turn

Although **The Corporate Wars** unfolds in real time, the system uses an internal turn structure to organize the processes of the simulated universe and maintain coherence.

The base scale is the so-called **strategic turn**, equivalent to one week  —approximately 168 hours— of simulated time.

This rhythm marks the general progression of the universe and determines, among other things, economic growth, political change, and the cumulative effects across the overall scenario.

Within each strategic turn, multiple **tactical turns** are deployed, depending on the level of activity and observation in each zone or situation.

In areas with direct player interaction, recent activity, or intensive surveillance, the simulation is detailed down to shorter and more precise cycles: production, labor shifts, construction, climate, ecological dynamics, or even combat are represented through fine-grained real-time processes.

In contrast, regions under low supervision are processed through broader internal turns, with lower temporal resolution, using synthesis models and general behavior patterns.

Thus, the world persists and advances continuously, but its level of detail adapts to the attention it receives, the narrative context, and the strategic relevance of each area.

Corporations adapt or disappear, prices shift, political balances change, and new challenges emerge even without direct intervention.

### Informational Fog — _Infog of War_

In **The Corporate Wars**, players have a partial and outdated view of the game: only _licensed_ operational _facilities_, or those with appropriate assigned _characters_, have access to local real-time information and the capacity to issue orders.

The rest of the _facilities_—whether owned or foreign—are seen with delays due to communication latency, showing the "version" corresponding to the latest available update.

The frequency of these updates depends on the traffic of interstellar routes between the observer's world and the observed world.

> Nearby worlds with little direct traffic rely on indirect routes—traveled more frequently—for informational updates, optimizing latency but increasing desynchronization.

Likewise, orders travel in the opposite direction: _licensed_ facilities or assigned _characters_ can issue orders locally in real time; otherwise, any instruction must be generated locally and sent through the same logistical network, with the same resulting delay.

## Operations and Missions

Beyond infrastructure management, players can deploy specialized agents to carry out targeted operations: sabotage, infiltration, negotiations, escorts, reconnaissance, information warfare, or asset recovery.

These missions are integrated in real time within the strategic map, directly impacting the course of events.

Operations are not random: each one responds to a specific context, need, or opportunity.

The difference between a surviving corporation and a leading one may come down to a well-executed tactical decision at the exact right moment.
