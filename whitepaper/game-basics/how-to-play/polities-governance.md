_Polities_ are entities organized around a collective interest; while they are often governments, they may also be institutions, cultural groups, interstellar councils, informal networks of influence —and, of course, corporations.

_Polities_ are classified according to their scale and level of organization: from sub-polities —such as provinces, colonies, or subordinate corporations— to supra-polities, which encompass multiple entities under a unified coordination.

A _Polity_ can be as small as an independent freighter or as vast as the Third Imperium, and it doesn't need to be sovereign to function as one.

Major _Allegiances_ are often composed of networks of _Polities_ aligned by culture, history, geography, or religion, organized to cooperate or resist greater powers without losing their functional identity.

In **The Corporate Wars**, corporations are affiliated with _Allegiances_; they accept their jurisdiction, tax obligations, and legal regulations.

## Governance in the Game

In The Corporate Wars, governance is directly integrated into the game's architecture: all relevant entities —contracts, licenses, authorizations, or sanctions— are recorded on the Solana network, linked to a verifiable chain of signatures that reflects the legal and political hierarchy of the simulated universe.

Each corporate interaction generates a compliance trace: operating on a world requires ascending legal validations, from the local level to the corresponding _Allegiance_.

Institutional layers impose constraints, condition permissions, and act as mandatory filters for any significant activity.

Non-compliance, if detected, triggers descending responses: sanctions, embargoes, revocation of privileges, or reputational damage.

The response depends on the severity of the offense, the scope of the affected entity, and the capacity —or **willingness**— of local authorities to enforce the law and pursue offenders.

The _blockchain_ infrastructure provides the legal backbone of the game, creating a verifiable framework where every legal, economic, or strategic decision has structural traceability.
