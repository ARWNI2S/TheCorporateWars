# Manage and Develop

Every ambitious corporation needs more than good intentions: it needs a foundation.

This section of the game focuses on the tangible � what is built, improved, and ultimately becomes the backbone of any sustained operation.

From the first orbital plant to complex interplanetary industrial networks, structural development defines the real capacity of a corporation.

### Production Networks

From planetary extraction sites to orbital assembly nodes, every element of the network must be connected through logistics chains � and their efficiency can be the difference between a fulfilled contract and a reputational crisis.

Location, facility type, automation levels, and contingency protection all determine performance.

In some cases, a poorly placed factory can be more expensive than having none at all.

### Research and Development

Corporations may invest in technological improvements, exclusive patents, advanced manufacturing techniques, or economic intelligence models.

Although the benefits can be immeasurable, R\&D also brings risks: leaks, sabotage, or intellectual property disputes. Projects must balance time, cost, and risk.

Some technologies may take entire cycles to produce results � but their impact can redefine an industry or secure a competitive advantage.
