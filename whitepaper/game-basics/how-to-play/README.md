# Gameplay

In **The Corporate Wars**, players immerse themselves in the universe of the year 1201 of the Third Imperium, taking on the role of corporations striving to carve out a place in a competitive, vast, and opportunity-rich environment.

The game unfolds in a shared and persistent universe, where each player's decisions influence the economic, political, and social balance of known space.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The game runs in persistent time, with simultaneous events across multiple regions, and allows players to operate both from a high-level strategic interface and through agents, specialists, or executives deployed in specific zones.
{% endhint %}

## The Corporation

Each player controls a corporate entity, licensed at the beginning of the game to operate in a single commercial sector or habitable world, depending on the selected license type and the _Allegiance_ subscribed.

The corporation's _facilities_ act as local command centers from which to expand through exploration, trade, alliances, influence, or confrontation, building a network that spans multiple worlds within the sector.

The decisions a player makes affect their trade network, allies, enemies, and their position within the galactic balance.

### Operational Bureaucracy

Every action carries weight, and each strategic move triggers consequences on a regional or galactic scale.

_Policies_ �_Allegiances_, governments, _institutions_� regulate and seek to control �and benefit from� every aspect of corporate life within their territories.

Bureaucracy is not just narrative flavor; it is an operational layer that determines what each corporation can do, where and under what conditions; what is legal and what is not, and under which jurisdictions.

Players must navigate a maze of bureaucratic regulations �licenses, concessions, permits, commissions, fees, and taxes� to maintain their _public image_ and _political relations_ intact.

***

Commercial operations intertwine with territorial strategy, technological research, and diplomatic power plays.

Resource management, agent deployment, expansion into new systems, and establishing key relationships with local or greater powers are central to progress.

> The player doesn�t just grow a corporation � they shape its place in galactic history.
