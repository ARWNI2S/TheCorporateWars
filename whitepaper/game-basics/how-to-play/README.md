# Gameplay

In **The Corporate Wars**, players immerse themselves in the universe of the year 1201 of the Third Imperium, taking on the role of interstellar corporations competing for economic, political, and technological dominance in a mature and highly developed galaxy.

> This setting extends the Golden Age of the *Traveller™* universe, respecting its physical laws, social structures, and core technologies, but projecting them 80 years into the future.

Players’ decisions are constrained by the principles of the *Traveller™* universe: no instant communication, unpredictable jump routes, fragmented political borders, and a galaxy filled with discovery, adventure, and danger.

In this environment, each corporation must build, produce, trade, and research; maintain infrastructure, move goods and people between worlds, and invest in networks of information, influence, and espionage.

The game blends economic simulation, territorial strategy, and emergent narrative, where diplomacy, propaganda, covert operations, and armed conflict intertwine with business.

## Game Summary

A game of **The Corporate Wars** is a real-time experience played in a shared and persistent universe, where time continues even when players are offline, and events unfold independently of any given session.

Players register a corporate _Policy_ affiliated with one of the _Allegiances_—major powers, alliances, or other factions—of known space.

Authorized with one or more operational _licenses_ to establish themselves in specific _facilities_, the _Policy_ must manage them efficiently: players must balance costs and revenues, face risks, collect profits, and absorb losses.

To do this, players are provided with a control interface from which they can execute operations, respond to events, consult information, and make strategic decisions.

However, all actions must be taken with partial information, subject to delays, errors, and manipulation typical of a universe with limited interstellar communication and outdated data.

***

**The Corporate Wars** is not just a massive strategy game, but a political-economic simulation with uniquely deep mechanics. This section summarizes the aspects that clearly distinguish it from other MMORTS titles—not just in terms of setting or architecture, but in how they directly affect gameplay.

Each of these mechanics influences how players perceive the universe, make decisions, and position themselves against the dynamic environment, other players, and the system's institutions.

### 🛰️ Real Operational Latency

Orders and updates are not instantaneous: distance, traffic, and context determine how long it takes for information or instructions to reach their destination.

> *“You order an attack today, but it reaches the target system three in-game days later. Meanwhile, the enemy may have moved.”*

***

### 🧾 Binding Contracts and Reputation

Operations are structured through contracts with legal terms and narrative consequences. Failing to deliver or arriving late affects reputation and may trigger penalties, audits, or intervention.

> *“You accept a transport contract from the IISS. If you fail to fulfill it, you lose access to Imperial ports for a cycle.”*

***

### 🧠 Reactive Environment

The universe responds organically to player success. If a corporation dominates a sector, Allegiances or powers may impose tariffs, oversight, or strategic countermeasures.

> *“Your pharmaceutical company controls five worlds: the SPA triples tariffs and a rival alliance funds local insurgents.”*

***

### 🧩 Modular Corporate Design

Corporations are not generic entities: each player must define their functional structure (commercial, logistical, covert, scientific...). You can't do everything.

> *“You're a financial firm. You can invest in ships but can't build or operate them directly.”*

***

### 🛂 Real Institutional Restrictions

Operating on certain worlds requires licenses, authorizations, or political influence. Not all sectors are open, and authorities can deny or revoke access.

> *“To open an office on a capital world, you need approval from the Imperial Ministry. You can buy it—or infiltrate someone.”*

***

### 🌐 Remote Influence

You don’t need constant physical presence to affect the universe. Decisions through proxies, investments, or remote logistical chains have significant impact.

> *“You fund a mining expedition on a fringe world: the discovery boosts the stock value of your corporation.”*

***

### 👤 Characters as Strategic Assets

Characters aren’t avatars, but specialized agents who bring unique abilities when assigned. Their management directly changes outcomes.

> *“You send your political analyst to a negotiation: they reduce the proposed sanctions by 50%.”*

***

### 🕵️ Narrative Fog of Information

Information is updated through logistical routes: what you know depends on what you see, and what you see depends on who or what is present. Deception, forgery, and interpretation are part of the game.

> *“A rival facility appears inactive. But it could be lagged intel. Do you attack? Spy? Wait for another update?”*

***

### 🧬 Relevant Multiscale Simulation

Unmonitored areas don’t freeze. They evolve through aggregate models that affect economics, ecology, and political systems.

> *“A background agricultural world suffers a blight. The drop in exports affects food prices across the subsector.”*

***

The game universe doesn’t revolve around the player, nor does it wait for them to act—it evolves independently, with its own rhythms and conflicts.

In this active and persistent ecosystem, each player is a piece in a greater network, where strategy, anticipation, and responsiveness define long-term success.

It’s also not a predefined story or a world built around characters.

The universe is autonomous and evolves according to its own dynamics, on a constant temporal basis, represented by simulation cycles that structure each scenario like a continuously evolving board game.

This approach allows for flexible, realistic gameplay, grounded in a decoupled design: sober, modular, and built on clearly defined functional domains.
