# The Corporate Wars

**The Corporate Wars** is a real-time strategy game (RTS) set in an open universe inspired by Traveller™, where players command interstellar corporations.

It weaves together economic simulation, exploration, logistical mastery, and emergent P2E dynamics, all within a persistent environment where each decision reshapes the system’s delicate balance.

***

## The Far Future

**The Corporate Wars** is set in a far future where humanity dominates the stars, coexisting with other intelligent life forms in a colorful multicultural web of Nations, Alliances, Empires, Sovereign Worlds, Millennia-Old Institutions, Organizations, and Private Companies.

> Players take control of one of these companies, and their goal is profit. To achieve this, they can **trade** goods, build **infrastructure**, invest in the **Interstellar Stock Market**, extract **resources**, **manufacture** products, or research **technologies**; while at the same time managing **assets**, handling **funds**, seeking **financing**, acquiring **licenses** and permits, and complying with local **regulations**.

### Technological Limits

The intelligent species of the galaxy possess **jump technology**, meaning that **interstellar ships** equipped with specialized engineering components known as **jump drives** can perform hyperluminal transits, reducing transport times between the stars from dozens (or hundreds) of years to just a few weeks.

Although ships can jump between the stars, no technology is known that can send information faster than light.

The enormous distances between the stars make instant communication unfeasible, and governments and interstellar powers must rely on physical systems to transport information.

From automated mail lines to independent freighters, private yachts, and military transports, all interstellar ships in the galaxy have at some point been part of the intricate flow of interstellar messaging.

This presents an additional challenge to players, who must handle the available information, arriving at facilities on different worlds in an asymmetrical, fragmented, and outdated manner — testing their ability to design commercial strategies and maintain logistics systems in an environment where the “fog of war” extends to knowledge itself.

### Social Limits

Although many worlds possess this technology and are integrated into **Interstellar Community**, many others are technologically dependent, and many more are in the process of development.

It is a cosmopolitan environment of asymmetric cultures and governments, where star systems depend on trade routes to stay connected with the rest of the galaxy.

Planetary structures on different worlds range from isolated colonies to megacities, socially organized in various ways, subject to a complex government structure.

The borders between empires are nodes of information, technological exchange, and cultural clash, and unexplored territories present new opportunities for cooperation, alliance, and expansion.

> Players will have to navigate a legal web of commitments, regulations, deadlines, and permits; complying with both local and interstellar governance; taking care of both their public image and their polítical relationships, to extend their influence across the galaxy.
