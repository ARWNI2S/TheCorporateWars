# The Corporate Wars

**The Corporate Wars** is a real-time strategy game (RTS) set in an open universe inspired by Traveller™, where players take command of interstellar corporations. It combines deep economic simulation, exploration, logistical management, and P2E mechanics within a persistent environment, where every decision has direct consequences on the game’s evolution and systemic balance.

#### The Information Problem

Interstellar distances render instant communication impossible. Radio waves cannot exceed the speed of light, and messages may take years to reach even the nearest star.

This makes trade routes the only reliable medium for information flow. Starships equipped with **jump drives** traverse space via **jump transits**, reducing communication latency to the timescale of transport itself. The logistics of interstellar mail — and the reliability of jump routes — is a structural challenge faced by every high-tech civilization, and has caused some of the greatest crises in galactic history.

This fragile system balances large-scale economic decentralization with local policy constraints. Players must adapt their strategies to overcome ruthless logistical limitations and navigate regulations imposed by interplanetary powers seeking to retain control over commerce and information channels.

In this setting, industry, banking, and trade are not just engines of progress — they are weapons in a shadow war for supremacy. From financial manipulation to political subjugation of key regions, every decision redefines the balance of power. Diplomacy is a veil, information is currency, and the **interstellar economy**... the true battlefield.
