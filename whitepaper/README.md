# The Corporate Wars

**The Corporate Wars** is a real-time strategy game (RTS) set in an open universe inspired by Traveller™, where players command interstellar corporations.

It weaves together economic simulation, exploration, logistical mastery, and emergent P2E dynamics, all within a persistent environment where each decision reshapes the system’s delicate balance.


### Inspired by Traveller™

**The Corporate Wars** pays homage to the legacy of Traveller™, one of the richest and most enduring science-fiction universes ever created:\
a foundational inspiration in crafting a setting where technological, social, and economic limits define every player’s decisions.

The Corporate Wars is developed under the Fair Use License of Mongoose Publishing / Far Future Enterprises, with whom we maintain an open and cordial relationship regarding potential future licensing as an official product.\
Traveller™ and all related elements are the intellectual property of Far Future Enterprises.

At present, this project stands as a respectful tribute, not an official adaptation.
