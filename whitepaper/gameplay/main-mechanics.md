# Main Mechanics

In the galaxy, corporations are not mere commercial entities: they are fundamental pillars of the interplanetary economy.

From free traders to institutionalized megacorporations, these organizations weave networks of production, transportation, financing, and power that span entire sectors.

Each corporation combines resources, technology, personnel, and political capital to expand, consolidate, or simply survive in an environment where slow communications, economic rivalries, and diplomatic tensions are the norm.

The core mechanics reflect this scenario: it is not enough to build, trade, or conquer; players must manage logistical chains, secure strategic information, maintain efficient command structures, and negotiate permits, concessions, and alliances across multiple levels.

The player does not command an omniscient empire. They control an organization with blind spots, dependent on agents, contracts, and fleets to operate across a fragmented galactic map, where absolute present knowledge is never available and every decision carries echoes far beyond what was anticipated.
