# Game Concept

**The Corporate Wars** unfolds in a persistent, living universe where players take control of corporations competing for influence, resources, and a position in the interstellar market.

**TCW** is a fusion of genres, combining RTS-style control with Tycoon-level simulation and resource management, all set within an MMO sci-fi universe with emerging P2E mechanics.

{% hint style="info" %}
The universe is governed by a fundamental truth:

Jump drives allow travel to other stars in relatively short times, but no _known_ device can transmit a message faster than the speed of light.
{% endhint %}

### MMO

TCW is a massive multiplayer universe where players coexist, trade, collaborate, and compete in real time.

However, communications are limited, and the information available to each player depends on the world from which they operate.

In this setting, players’ intentions and their perception of the game world depend on their access to interstellar transit routes.

Each headquarters, station, or colonial outpost perceives the galaxy through the prism of the data that has reached its system: _trade notifications_ delayed by **weeks**, _diplomatic dispatches_ **outdated** upon arrival, _news of distant conflicts_ that may already have been **resolved**.

{% hint style="success" %}
The galaxy is a mosaic of local versions, a desynchronized symphony where absolute knowledge of the present is, by definition, unattainable.
{% endhint %}

### RTS

Unlike conventional RTS games, TCW offers no direct or omniscient control over all operations: success depends not just on player clicks, but on the corporation’s actual ability to execute on the ground.

{% hint style="info" %}
Players issue orders and design strategies, but these are transmitted via interstellar mail routes, subject to the delays and constraints of physical transit between systems.
{% endhint %}

The universe offers no real-time data or instant remote control: what a player knows depends on received reports and available connections.

Operational leadership relies on characters with specific skills — executives, fleet commanders, logistics experts — or, in more advanced worlds, on AI systems capable of managing part of the operation.

Without them, facilities and units continue to function… but limited to predefined routines, incapable of adapting or making decisions on their own.

### Tycoon

Players do not merely command armies: they manage complex systems of **trade**, **diplomacy**, **espionage**, and **logistics**, overseeing facilities, personnel, and supply networks built or acquired by their corporation.

{% hint style="info" %}
The corporate headquarters is the core of decision-making. From there, the universe is perceived: the available data reflects the informational state of connected regions, never the totality of the galaxy.
{% endhint %}

Running a corporation in TCW is much more than moving goods: it’s about navigating a web of licenses, concessions, and shares that determine who can operate, where, and under what conditions.

These elements are not mere assets: they are dynamic, negotiable, mortgageable, and subject to risk, espionage, or political intervention.

In TCW, leadership is not just about accumulation: it’s about building influence, reputation, and power networks in a universe where a single permit can open — or close — entire empires.

### P2E

TCW’s economic ecosystem does not revolve around monetized rewards or speculative crypto models.

The integration with blockchain — specifically, Solana — is a technical necessity: to maintain a distributed network of worlds that store their compressed, encrypted states, with updates registered as on-chain transactions.

{% hint style="success" %}
Each world acts as a node within an interstellar traffic network, where routes determine latency and, thus, the version of the state visible from any other system.
{% endhint %}

The Play-to-Earn model in TCW emerges as a mechanism of self-sustainability: it helps finance network costs, transaction fees, and infrastructure maintenance, while opening the door for the community to contribute to the project’s future development.

Here, playing to earn does not mean extracting value — it means participating in a living ecosystem, where every action helps sustain the shared universe.
