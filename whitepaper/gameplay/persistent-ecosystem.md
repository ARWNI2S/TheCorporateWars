# The Foundations of the Universe

The universe of **The Corporate Wars**, inspired by Traveller™, is not just background: it is the historical and conceptual infrastructure of the game.

It defines which worlds are connected, what data flows, what permissions exist, what alien civilizations are known, and what regions remain unexplored.

{% hint style="info" %}
On this foundation, a persistent ecosystem is built where decisions have real, cumulative, and long-term impact.
{% endhint %}

This is not just a stage for adventures: it is a setting where technology, society, economy, and motivations intertwine.

> Technological science sets what is possible; social science gives shape to cultures.

The technological diversity among worlds, the cosmopolitan nature of the universe, the (relative) dominance of humans, the values of honor, duty, or loyalty, and the absence of any "prime directive" create a setting where **everything** is driven by economics.

In this framework, corporations are not mere actors: they are the true characters... Money, power, and information determine who rises and who falls... The rules are complex, with overlapping interests and hidden layers... And that's where the game begins...

## The Third Survey

The universe of **The Corporate Wars** is set around year 1200 of the **Imperial Calendar**. The **Third Imperium** spans more than _eleven thousand_ worlds, under the nominal authority of **Emperor** _Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi_.

Known history has avoided the fractures that devastated other timelines: there was no Rebellion, no Virus, no collapse into the New Era. It is a universe full of tensions, ambitions, and challenges, yet it maintains the structural continuity of classic Traveller™ timelines like Mongoose, GT, and T20, where the Imperial Milieu continues its course, building on what was laid down in past star surveys:

* [x] **First Survey**: the first major imperial exploratory effort, cataloging inhabited worlds, jump corridors, and initial frontiers.
* [x] **Second Survey**: a systematic update that redefined major routes and formalized trade and contact lines.
* [ ] And now, in the present, the **Third Survey** has begun: a monumental initiative of the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service in collaboration with the private sector, the **Hakyeahtaorl**, the **Driantia Dazhia**, the **Two Thousand Worlds**, and even **SolSec**, to map not only known space, but also marginal worlds, forgotten frontiers, and enclaves left behind after the Long Night.

## A Persistent and Asymmetric Universe

The universe of **The Corporate Wars** is not just a game board: it is a dynamic, changing ecosystem, and, above all, unequal in terms of information, power, and access. Directly inspired by Traveller™, it reflects a setting where:

* Information is not always up to date;
* Layers of authority overlap between Imperium, local systems, alien factions, and corporations;
* Decisions made today may have consequences recorded and claimed years or even decades later.

This level of persistence, asynchrony, and complexity is not just window dressing: it is the backbone of the game.

Therefore, its technical implementation requires robust, scalable, and auditable solutions.

The choice to use blockchain infrastructure is not a commercial gimmick but a technical decision: it is the optimal means to manage historical records, distributed governance, property rights, and verifiable transactions over time.
{% endhint %}

Participatory governance systems, smart contracts, and tokenized assets allow the game to represent the structures of ownership, delegation, and authority that have defined the Traveller™ universe since the First Vilani Imperium, through the Long Night, and into the present.

### Staged Deployment: History and Development

The deployment of the universe follows a phased plan aligned with the historical stages of the lore:

* **Milieu 0**: installation and configuration, limited to the vicinity of Sylea and the Core sector, with no formal surveys; only echoes of the imperial past.
* **First Survey**: initial deployment phase; funding of planetary infrastructures (Resource Units), initial allocation (vesting) of megacredits (MCr), discovery of old maps predating the Second Survey, opening of adventures centered on derelict ships and forgotten enclaves.
* **Second Survey**: consolidation of trade routes, progressive registration on the Interstellar Stock Exchange (ISE) —a historic institution that survived even the Long Night— and gradual implementation of game modules.
* **Third Survey**: the current moment of the game, marked by the Open Beta or Final Launch, where the universe persists as a living, mutable, interconnected environment.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Storage and deployment on Solana come with resource costs (for example, accounts, records, and on-chain data). Therefore, the pace of expansion and activation of new phases will depend on community reception and real demand for participation, ensuring sustainable and efficient growth.
