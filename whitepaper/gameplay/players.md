# Players

In TCW, every player builds their own story within a vast, indifferent universe full of opportunity.

There are no fixed paths to victory: some will dominate markets, others will win wars, some will weave alliances or reinvent the rules.

But all will share the same challenge: to survive, grow, and leave their mark on a galaxy where even information has a price â€”and the greatest victories are often invisible.
