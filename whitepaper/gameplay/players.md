# Players

In TCW, each player builds their own story in a vast, indifferent universe full of opportunities.

There are no fixed paths to victory: some will dominate markets, others will win wars, others will weave alliances or rewrite the rules.

But all will face the same challenge: to survive, grow, and leave their mark in a galaxy where even information has a price, and the greatest victories are often invisible.

### Corporations as characters

In The Corporate Wars, players do not embody individuals but entire corporations: living entities combining economic power, political influence, and strategic ambition.

{% hint style="info" %}
From the moment of creation, each corporation defines its identity through initial operating licenses, choosing a role on the vast galactic stage.
{% endhint %}

Gameplay is not just about accumulating resources: it’s about building networks, navigating regulatory webs, competing for power, and even shaping the fate of entire systems.

The corporation is the true character, and its story is yours to write.

## Operating licenses

At the start, each player selects a specific operating license. This defines the sector they can operate in, the opportunities available, and the challenges they will face.

While corporations can diversify or reinvent themselves over time, the initial license leaves a deep imprint on their playstyle.

### Colonial services

Corporations managing energy, life support, communications, and logistics in young or remote colonies.

> Suitable for those seeking stability, local influence, and steady income.

### Trade and transport

Managing fleets, routes, contracts, and logistics. The dynamic heart of interstellar commerce.

> Ideal for explorers and merchants in speculative markets.

### Resource exploitation

Extraction and processing of strategic resources. A mix of production, defense, and market strategy.

> For industrial players with a long-term vision.

### Manufacturing

Production of consumer goods, technology, or industrial equipment. Process and supply chain optimization.

> Appealing to builders and planners.

### Security and defense

Managing private forces, security, and tactical operations. Risk control and working in high-pressure environments.

> A challenge for players who enjoy military influence and strategic tension.

### Advanced licenses

These activities require massive capital, special permits, and the ability to navigate the game’s most complex layers.

#### Research

Scientific and technological development. Innovating to gain competitive advantages, even under legal restrictions or in gray zones.

> For those who bet on progress as the engine of dominance.

#### Banking

Controlling the flow of capital on an interstellar scale. Financing governments, managing investments, shaping markets.

> For players seeking to dominate through finance, influencing entire systems.

#### Starport operations

Managing private terminals or even full starports.

Controlling access to galactic trade, reducing costs, and establishing exclusive logistical networks.

> Ideal for those wanting to build empires from economic infrastructure.

## Alliances

In The Corporate Wars, no corporation is forced to operate alone. Alliances —known in-game as guilds— allow players to coordinate efforts, share resources, establish non-aggression pacts, or act as economic and political blocs.

These groups can have varied goals: from monopolizing a market sector, imposing trade rules in a region, coordinating frontier system defense, to influencing interplanetary politics through collective governance mechanisms.

### Governance and interstellar bureaucracy

The game does not operate in a lawless vacuum: every corporate action interacts with bureaucratic systems at multiple levels.

* Local governments,
* interstellar alliances,
* starport authorities,
* regulatory entities,
* and international financial consortia

impose rules, restrictions, and opportunities. Alliances can play a central role in this ecosystem: acting as pressure groups, setting internal norms, negotiating collective concessions, or even imposing their own authority in deregulated regions.

### Dynamic contexts

The interaction between corporations, alliances, and external powers shapes a scenario where nothing is static.

The decisions of a few affect many: a trade blockade, an open conflict, a broken alliance, or an imposed regulation can alter entire markets, reconfigure logistical routes, or trigger domino effects impacting the galaxy on a massive scale.
