# Rethink P2E

In **The Corporate Wars**, there is no Play-to-Earn (P2E) model as such; there is no automatic reward mechanic, but rather a **structural consequence** of corporate performance within the persistent universe.

The economic ecosystem of **The Corporate Wars** is designed for corporations to generate, use, and reinvest resources in productive, competitive, and strategic cycles.

Only those corporations capable of achieving **real net surpluses**, after covering all operational, fiscal, and maintenance obligations, will be able to withdraw value outside the game.

It is not a right nor a promise: it is an **exceptional** result, reflecting dominance, efficiency, and sustainability.

## Key differences from traditional P2E models

The **The Corporate Wars** model stands out because:

* **It does not deliver passive income.** There are no rewards for prolonged staking, mere token ownership, or "minimum activity".
* **It does not depend on external inflows.** The economy is self-sustaining: it does not require attracting new players to maintain internal value.
* **It does not guarantee returns.** Returns emerge from corporate success, not from predefined rates or automatic emissions.
* **It is competitive.** Not all corporations will reach surpluses; many will operate at cost, others will go bankrupt, and only a few will stand out.

### Conditions for withdrawing MCr

The MegaCredits (**MCr**) are the main monetary unit of **The Corporate Wars**, algorithmically backed and balanced against the game's aggregated economic activity.

The withdrawal of MCr outside the ecosystem is subject to the following conditions:

* **Net surplus:** the corporation must generate profits exceeding operational costs, amortizations, asset maintenance, licenses, fees, and minimum reserves.
* **Real liquidity:** the available balance must be liquid and free of encumbrances. Committed assets, capital locked in operational staking, or pending guarantees do not count.
* **Sustainability:** the withdrawal must not endanger the corporation's operational capacity, as determined by backend automatic calculations (e.g., reserves for payroll cycles, supplies, obligations to community pools).
* **On-chain validation:** any withdrawal request undergoes a technical validation process on the Solana network, ensuring traceability, legitimate origin, and compliance with game and governance rules.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The withdrawal of MCr is not a feature available to all players or corporations. It is a **consequence** reserved for those who manage to build efficient, solvent, and strategically dominant organizations.

## Risks and limitations

* **Internal volatility:** prices, costs, and margins in the **The Corporate Wars** universe are dynamic; today's surplus may turn into a deficit after a macroeconomic event.
* **On-chain operational costs:** withdrawal involves technical fees (computation, transaction, storage) to be covered by the applicant.
* **Reputational impact:** withdrawing large capital may affect polítical relationships, alliances, or trust indices in the ISE.
* **No guaranteed recovery:** an executed withdrawal is irreversible and does not guarantee preferential return to the ecosystem.

## Summary

The rethinked P2E model of **The Corporate Wars** is not a token distribution system: it is a structural framework where value arises from interaction, competition, and efficiency. Only those corporations that manage to generate net, free, and sustainable surpluses can, under technical validation, withdraw MCr outside the game.

The real challenge is not extracting value: it is **building an organization capable of consistently generating it** without compromising its survival in a universe that does not forgive mistakes.
