# **The Corporate Wars**

**The Corporate Wars** is a large-scale economic and strategic simulation video game set in a distant future inspired by the classic *Traveller™* universe.

Developed by **Alternate Reality Worlds**, this project combines worldbuilding, blockchain integration, economic modeling, and distributed systems to create a unique interactive experience where corporations, states, and players compete for control across interstellar space.

## Concept

The game simulates a persistent world with its own population, production chains, political systems, and market dynamics. Players act as stakeholders in corporations, governments, or factions competing over limited resources, technological dominance, and influence.

Inspired by the tone and aesthetic of *Traveller™*, but entirely original in mechanics and structure, the game leverages:

- Real-time economic simulation
- Blockchain tokenized assets (SPL / Token-2022)
- Distributed infrastructure and services
- Integration with Solana smart contracts
- Strategic and narrative gameplay layers
